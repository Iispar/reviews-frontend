        "body": "Normally I don't like mystery novels but this one was really good. I couldn't put it down. Just when you think it couldn't get any better, it does!It's about Robert Langdon. He's a Harvard professor of symbology. When in Paris on business he gets an urgent late-night phone call. A curator has been murdered inside the Louvre and by the body, a code he wrote before he died which includes the words 'Find Robert Langdon'. The police assume that this means that Robert killed him. With the help of the curator's cryptologist granddaughter he deciphers the code (slowly but surely). One code leads them to another, so on and so forth. Soon, they discover the curator was a member of the Priory of Sion - a real secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo and Da Vinci. This society was rumored to know where the Holy Grail is.I'd tell you more but I might ruin it.It's a very exciting book.Even if you, like me, aren't a fan of mystery novels, you should read this. It's very good.I suggest you read it's prequel, Angels & Demons, first.",

As far as I can see, Dan Brown has taken a mis-mash of tired old theories about the power of the Church and symbology and formed them into a pretty good thriller.  There is very little new here in the way of ideas and the writing style is not particularly lyrical (two things that I personally like in novels.)  Umberto Eco has done somewhat the same thing in Foucault's Pendulum and he did it infinitely better.",

        "body": "Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code purports to be an brainy thriller of the same stripe as Umberto Eco's [[ASIN:015603297X Foucault's Pendulum]] or Iain Pear's [[ASIN:1573227951 An Instance of the Fingerpost]], but it isn't, quite: it's a stupid - very stupid - thriller spliced with rather a lot of meticulous (I'm not sure I'd necessarily stretch to 'brainy') research on some cloak and dagger Christian stuff.The research side is interesting enough, to be sure, and had Dan Brown set out to write and idiot's guide to Christian Symbolism in art and literature (i.e., had he left the thriller element out of it altogether), I'd have been more charitable in my assessment of his book. It is good meaty, controversial stuff. I couldn't give a fig whether it's true or not, to be honest, as long as it gets up the nose of the religious authorities, which apparently it has. Kudos to Mr. Brown for that.But the thriller? Dear, oh dear. There's not one element of it that passes muster.Firstly, the characterisation is astoundingly weak - so weak that it completely undermines the unfolding plot.  The gating question Dan Brown fails to answer is this: why would a four-by-two, dull-as-ditchwater university beak, actually do any of this?Next, the dialogue throughout is awful (a large contributor to the woodenness of the characterisation) and about three of the characters seem to 'chime' everything rather than saying it. Grrr.Then the plot, however you look at it, is plain ridiculous. We asked to believe that, among other things (NB the following aren't really spoilers):* pillar-of-respectability Robert Langdon, a world-renowned Harvard professor of symbolism, before even informally being accused of a crime he manifestly could not have committed, would seek to run from local judicial police (instead of co-operating with their inquiries) to the extent of (among other things) hot-wiring an armoured truck, breaking through police lines in a borrowed Range Rover and fleeing French airspace in an illegally chartered plane.* the murder victim's grand-daughter Sophie - estranged from said victim for ten years (as a result of witnessing him participate in a bizarre sex cult) and a complete stranger to Langdon, herself an employee of the French Police's cryptology department to boot (convenient, eh wot?) - would be the prime mover in Langdon's decision to do, and his main accomplice in doing, this, thus (one would think) completely obliterating her own career in public service in the process for the sake of a dead man she manifestly thought was a pervert.* on the run from the French judicial police (as well as a rather nasty bovver boy from Vatican hardliners Opus Dei), said professor would frequently stop and deliver lengthy homilies to said granddaughter about L. Da Vinci, the Priory of Sion, the Merovingian Kings, the Knights Templar and all the other usual suspects of Christian legend.* The point of the pair's flight from justice is apparently not to prove Langdon's innocence, nor solve the actual murder themselves, but instead to find - on this night, of all nights - documentary proof of the last resting place of the most Holy Grail itself.* that this, along with all other action in the novel (and there's plenty more, you may rest assured) takes place in the course of one uninterrupted evening. About four lines in the novel suggest that Sophie and Robert may also get it on. What a busy pair!Now I know fiction is all about the suspension of disbelief, but this is ridiculous. We are introduced to an increasingly ludicrous array of plot-functional characters as the drama goes on, whilst Brown spoon feeds his hysterical theories of Christian cover-ups, secret societies and hidden symbols by way of unsolicited authorial essay, pompous soliloquy (usually delivered, as noted, in the teeth of approaching police and/or bovver boys), or straight-out travelogue. There are pages of The Da Vinci Code that read like [[ASIN:0312385811 Let's Go Paris]].Where the opportunity really knocked was to fold the symbolism Brown has researched into the text of the novel itself. This is what sets apart the likes of Umberto Eco - real skill in the craft of writing. None is in evidence here. There is no figurative structure at all, which is remarkable for a book all about hidden codes, so it is really a straight out holiday page-turner.Which is why the masses like it, and have bought it in their droves: The Da Vinci Code is a dead easy read, but one can feel the achievement of having read (and understood!) a book described on its cover as 'erudite'.Makes me sound like a snob, doesn't it?So be it.Olly Buxton312385811 Let's Go Paris]].

        "body": "The Da Vinci Code is a good story. If it had been better written it could have been a great book. However, to my mind, the author took a deep subject and glossed over so much interesting material, it felt as though he were writing a screen play. I could almost see Harrison Ford reprising his Nevada Jones role with a shallow, red headed bimbo instead of a blond one. That isn't fair to the female character who is, of course, brilliant as well as beautiful. Since the book is all about the female as a religious power it seemed a poor way to treat the female protagonist.  It really is a good story. The author has taken an arcane subject with numerous dimensions and woven a good tale. He has a good imagination. Unfortunately, he is not a good enough writer to turn his good story into a great book. His characters are flat and pretty much the usual fare. It could have been a Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, probably much better. These books use a lot of the same imagery and historical/mystical metaphor. Nicolas Flamel, who invented the Philosophers Stone in Harry Potter, turns out to have been a one time Grand Master of the Knights Templar or Priory of Sion from 1398-1418. Other Grand Masters were Botticelli, Da Vinci and Isaac Newton.  I was disappointed, after all the hype, but what else is new? Dan Brown turned a fascinating subject into a glossy bit of frippery and left an ending that is clearly designed to allow for a sequel.",

I will only name the main intriguing characters: Symbologist Robert Langdon,  Agent Sophie Neveu and Curator Jacques Sauniere who have relationships to the Opus Dei, a keystone, Cryptex, Masons, Knights Templar, the Holy Grail and so much more.There is an abundance of fascinating chronicaled facts in this well-woven novel and it is sometimes difficult to separate fact from fiction,  fabricated from legendary.  It is a sexual book but not about sex.  The dissertation on diverse codes and 'word games' is engaging but frustrating if we are wont to figure it out on our own. It's unnecessary to condemn this book, written as a novel, as 'anti-Catholic.'The author has extensive authoritative command of sundry, disparate areas of knowledge which are inspiring and attest to his research & the attention he paid to weaving intrigue, trivia and legends in poignant style. It is an amazing, absorbing, and accomplished mystery story where the reader gradually learns who really are the good vs. the bad guys.  This is a must read which takes little effort to open the cover, especially with the illustrations! -- then the book's enticements take over.  Worthy inveiglements relate to codes within the book, some of which are smoke and others allegorical and the later edition which is nicely illustrated and features prints of historic places of Europe that are discussed in the text and are well-received.  Do get this illustrated edition!  The book's price is more than fair.",

Though by adult literary standards, the book is fairly weak, it should serve as a great start for young people interested in the adventure of European history.  I sincerely applaud that.Unfortunately Brown and his editors made the choice to preface the book with specific claims concerning 'Fact' and 'Accuracy.'  This was a strange decision.  Mr. Brown's interpretations are his own business, but he is swearing that the basic facts on documents and art objects are correct.  As has already been shown in 'The New York Times' and others, this is unquestionably untrue.  The book has more factual holes in it than a mound of Swiss (Secret Bank Account) Cheese.  Are we then to assume that Mr. Brown and his publishers are simply incompetent, or were they knowingly dishonest.  If someone sells me a painting they say is real but turns out to be a forgery, it is a crime.  Here an author and publisher have made tens of millions of dollars peddling a book to millions of people, to a large degree because they claim it is based on controversial but accurate information.  Now that much of that basic information is turning out to be false, isn't that a clear-cut case of fraud?  No accusations here, just an honest question.I hold a MA degree from an Ivy League school and have lived in Europe for many years.  I am concerned about how much deceit I see in American culture these days.  I, for one, will be trying not to buy books from Doubleday in the future.  I hope Mr. Brown continues to serve up his platters of fun for young people, but I hope very much that he and his publishers decide to retract their false claims to accuracy.  Besides, my experience has been that the truth (or at least an honest attempt based on current research) about a number of the areas Brown touches on is much more interesting than the tired myths and legends he serves up here, albeit in a zippy new package.",

It is garbage for the gulliable, or more precisely, for the half-educated and those who passed through school and university after history and theology ceased being taught there.To quote another reviewer: &quot;Same old lies. Hardly any of this background is original. Most of it is derived from the fantasy-disguised-as-history work 'Holy blood, Holy Grail,' and the rest is cobbled from other bits of well-worn and risible muggests of esoteric and Gnostic conspiracy theories.&quot;The Catholic Church is shown as brutal, repressive and murderous. I am not a Catholic, so I have no particular reason to take offense, except that all this untruth should be offensive to anyone, and I feel angry on behalf of the many good Catholics I know. Its attitude to Catholicism and Christianity is simply vicious bigotry.Among the ludicrous historical errors presented as part of the factual back-ground are the alleged facts that the Divinity of Christ was invented by the Roman Emperor Constantine, and voted on at the Council of Nicea.There is a claim the Church killed five million accused witches during the medieval period. This is also utterly, ludicrously false.This is a frankly degenerate work - it is not even well-written as a suspense thriller - aiming to exploit the gulliability of the modern half-educated and its success is a depressing comment on the state of our civilization.",

I know it's fiction, but I find it disturbing that those who are unfamiliar with either Biblical or Art history might embrace Brown's attempt to discredit the divinity of Jesus Christ.  There are many flaws in his theory.  Christ never demeaned women.  If you look at every episode where Christ encountered a woman in the New Testament, his tenderness and respect is evident.  Also, Mary Magdalene was probably old enough to be Christ's mother.  In Greek, the oldest woman was always listed first and in every instance where Mary Magdalene was listed in the New Testament, she is listed first, even before Jesus's mother.  Which probably made her a woman comfortably into middle age.   I don't know if Brown just has a bone to pick with the Catholic church, but he treats it as if it's the ONLY Christian church in existence.  There are plenty of us Bible-believing non-Catholics out there who believe the Bible is God's holy word and are trying to worship and live our lies in accordance with the guidelines Christ left for us in the New Testament.  Christ was both divine and human and that's the major point that Brown seems determined to discredit.  If you can suspend disbelief and not mistake the combination of legend and conspiracy theories for fact, then you can probably enjoy this book.  A similar, but much better written, book is the cult classic THE EIGHT by Katherine Neville.",

Dan Brown did a wonderful job of giving the reader an education that is, at the same time, fun and interesting by brilliantly presenting true history, religion, and cultural information within the framework of a fictional mystery story. The only other book I have seen that does that is Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point...Thomas Jefferson&quot; which also quite brilliantly presents true history and philosophy within the framework of a HarryPotter-like fantasy.  Dan Brown's &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is truly a unique and memorable book. If you are a lover of books and learning, I recommend that you do not miss reading this book (nor Remick's, either).",

It's a shocking supposition about Christianity that has many people up in arms, especially after the &quot;20/20&quot; segment that recently aired regarding this book.  Nevertheless, this is America - where you are free to speak, read, or write any story you want.  True or not, this book is an exciting and suspenseful read.  You don't have to believe in it to become absorbed by it.  And you will.  Enjoy!",

The factoids contained within the work ( the &quot;Divine Proportion&quot; being a terribly interesting example) are well-spaced and many are totally mind-boggling. They teach the reader without drawing him/her into the spiraling abyss of a pedants mind. The characters are humanly possible, quite life-like actually, and the scenes are well-described, yet still seem to stay to-the-point. I won't bore you with a long-winded summary, considering you have probably perused one in one of the previous reviews. The bottm line is that this book is a great read and should be enjoyed by all who can get their hands on it. As Poe once wrote, &quot;Quoth the Raven, read this book.&quot; (hehe)",

I'll focus on the CD version.The book is narrated on 13 CDs in standard CDA format. Each CD contains about 25 tracks, each containing 3 to 4 minutes of narrative. This is more time than most CDs contain and it causes problems. I have four CD players in my house and not one of them could read the last five or six tracks from each CD without pausing, skipping, or crackling. I even returned the first set but had exactly the same problems with the second set.I downloaded some software specifically designed to recover bad CDs but even when I turned all the error correction options on, it still couldn't read some of the tracks. I have to conclude the CDs are not correctly burned. Who ever produced these CDs did a very poor job and really let Dan Brown, Paul Michael, and Random House down.Although it wouldn't bother most people, I noticed that the track information between CDs is inconsistent with track and album names being different formats between CDs. As I was trying to rip the CDs so I could listen to them on my iPod, I found myself taking a lot of time to re-enter the information in a consistent manner so the tracks would play in the correct order.I would have given this four stars if the CDs had been burned correctly. Perhaps Costco had a bad batch.",

Eco writes Fiction like it is non-fiction and the reader can get bogged down in the all the details, distracting from the enjoyment.  I hate to say Brown is a dumbed down version of Eco, but I think that is the case.  And I applaud him for it.  I actually found the lack of character developement refreshing as I didn't want how they looked or whether they fell in love or not to get in the way of the story.  Admittedly, there are some big theoretical leaps in the way the history and facts are presented, but hey, it's fiction.  Try not to overanalyze it.",

He changes well known facts about art history, in particular, Leonardo Da Vinci's life and work.  He also changes well documented history of the formation of the Catholic church, the canonization of the Bible, and 4th century concepts of Jesus' divinity.  It is obvious why he did this...to be polemic.  It (obviously) sells books!  He follows historical fact as far as it serves his story's purposes.  But, when he needed to spice up the story or maintain plot he freely changed historical facts to fiction.  If nothing else, my hope is that The Da Vinci Code will spark curiosity in all of these readers so that they will do their own research.

And that is how excellent writing should be. I also love the delving into an ancient real-life secret society and into the history of Christianity and of the basis of our current moral code. It definitely opened my mind about some things while at the same time helped me confirm the inklings of my own intuition. There is a tremendous build-up and one may say that the novel runs out of gas (hardly), but I think it unfolds brilliantly, leaving it up to the reader to decide what the character does after the mystery is solved.",

In fact, the detective story was cookie cutter, and I found that I could predict things several chapters before they actually happened.  No, the intruiging part for me was the immaculate research on Da Vinci and the secret society and the concept of the holy grail that Dan Brown did.  It was the first time I had been exposed to these ideas, and found them impecably interesting.  It was like taking a history class in a book, where learning is made more interesting.

And that's even before it becomes a movie, which it undoubtedly will.As literature, however, the book can best be described as formulaic. The writing style is more than a tad wooden, and the protagonists careen from one narrow escape to the next. The author doesn't just foreshadow events, he all but rents billboards to announce them. Most amusing, those trying to unravel the puzzles and clues presented in the book are supposed to be skilled at cryptography and symbolism, but it took pages and pages for them to come up with the ancient word for wisdom. Hmmm. I guess they weren't quite as well schooled in those subjects as the author thought.From a historical perspective, the key word to remember here is 'fiction.' A lot of the art history in the book is fascinating, and the author weaves in plenty of intriguing (though not necessarily accurate) tidbits about everything from the Knights Templar to Opus Dei. But many of his 'revelations' are either nothing new or totally untrue. This is somewhat ironic, considering that several characters talk of the need to keep the story of the Holy Grail alive and accurate.This is a great book on an airplane or at the beach--providing plenty of detail without slowing the pace. But when it comes to questions of faith or historical accuracy, I'll seek elsewhere.",

The protagonist, Robert Lagdon, along with Sophia Neveau find themselves on a wild journey from the Mona Lisa in Paris, to Westminster Abbey in England trying to find the secret to the Holy Grail.  But this is no treasure hunt, the Grail holds a disturbing secret, that if revealed would mean a drastic change in Western religion, thats not very clear but its hard not to give anything away.  The riddles and mysteries that they uncover are brillient, and have sometimes triple or quadruple meanings that all connect in the end.  The book may not end in with a huge bang but I felt it was fitting and beautiful. Everything is wrapped up and concluded nicely.  In conclusion, The DaVinci Code is facinating, suspensful, and completely opens the doors to new ideas about Christianity.  Just thinking about how all the riddles and symbols came together, I can only wonder at how Dan Brown did it.",

Brown fails on all four accounts. The book is just trivial, and not more than that. It even fails on Europe and Catholic bashing by getting facts wrong that would have required much less research than renaissance symbolism. (I do not mind the bashing, it's the artist's freedom - but I prefer informed bashing).Yes, I admit, I needed an encyclopedia when reading Eco's  Name of the Rose or Foucault's Pendulum - but I was never bored . In fact, I learned a lot and had fun at the same time. If the reviewer wants us to believe that Brown is some sort of a Turbo-Eco - nothing could be more misleading than that; at least the publisher should have known better. Eco could have written this book with only his cerebellum working.But the book has a good side too. Numerous American readers are now flocking to the Louvre, contributing to much needed revenues. As the guided tours concentrate only on those few pieces referred to in the 'da Vinci Code', unfortunately the visitors will miss out cultural enlightenment. But that is the curse of a civilization that has adopted the fast food principle, which it had invented, to the understanding of other cultures (as is evidenced by the many factual misrepresentations of Europe and Catholicism in the book).Finally, Dan Brown defeats himself by invoking Leonardo da Vinci's name in the title. His artistic dwarfism is most apparent in contrast to the genius of Leonardo.of Leonardo. ",

The writing was fast-paced, intriguing, and had me breathlessly turning the pages hoping to discover what our hero and heroine were trying to discover---the Holy Grail.  Beginning with a grisly murder at the Louvre Museum, the reader is tantalized by clues hidden in poems, numbers, and various designs.  Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu are never fully developed as characters, but it's all right because in this book, the chase is everything.  The chase to find the Holy Grail and discover its secret is paramount.My only complaint with the book is that it fictionalizes real people and real events and rewrites history in such a way to attempt to undermine Christianity.  While most readers are smart enough to distinguish between fact and fiction, this does plant a lot of innuendo, legend, and rumor masquerading as fact.  My advice is to take it for what it's worth...an exceptionally good thriller...and not to take too seriously its rewriting of historical and Biblical fact. On the upside, this book had me searching websites for factual information moreso than any book I've ever read.  I have also learned more about the works of Leonardo Da Vinci than I ever knew before and finally think I know why the Mona Lisa is smiling.",

Brown has authored a masterpiece...it is polished...and has no weaknesses.  Consequently, I urge any business person who is taking a long trip and will spend many hours in airports and flying...to pick up this book.  I don't think its fair to share the plot with you.  I don't want to spoil the fun.  Of all the books I have reviewed for Amazon to date...&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is by far the most entertaining.  Highly recommended.Bert Ruiz",

        "body": "My wife read this book first and enjoyed its mysteries, revelations and pacing, but was uncomforable with its portrayal of Christianity. I share her feelings, but we both agree the novel is worthwhile as a guilty pleasure. The book is cleverly and expertly done. The use of real historical organizations, such as the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei, and Knights Templar give it a serious, true-life sense. The fact that larger-than-life historical figures like da Vinci were involved with -- and even led -- The Priory of Sion gives it wonder. And author Dan Brown has cooked up a clever premise in which the foundation of Christianity would be shaken if the 'truth' were known. And so the chase is on, with a symbologist, a cryptologist, and eventually a Royal historian solving riddles and rhymes in their search for the Holy Grail, with the French and eventually English authorities nipping at their heels as they are blamed for an increasing number of murders.But what starts out as a fascinating cerebral adventure with a near literary tone can't quite hold that highminded course. What commences as wine and filet mignon dwindles to cola and hamburger. Maybe that's what happens when you cross the channel. The richest parts of the book come when we are in the head of the protagonist, Robert Langdon -- especially at the beginning, when he sees a historical, even ancient, symbolism in practically every object that meets his eye. These roots of our now familiar symbols are fascinating. But when the chase is on and ongoing puzzles need to be solved, they become tedious and even simplistic. The 'difficult' clue concerning Sir Isacc Newton and an orb? Duh! And the 'unseen' bad guy was all too obvious. Plus, I don't really think the French and English police are as dumb, naive and comical as this book would lead you to believe. However, when Ron Howard and his 'Brilliant Mind' team produce the movie, as I've read they will do, I'm sure a lot of these discrepancies will be ironed out. Hopefully, the movie will hold to that rich Mona Lisa atmosphere the book so promisingly begins with. I have faith.As for the attack on Christianity, when He was arrested Jesus told Peter to put up his sword. Because, if He needed to, He'd bring down legions of angels to kick butts. That's good enough for me. Meanwhile, everyone should enjoy The Da Vinci Code and take it for what it is -- a work of fiction built from elastic facts, like looking at clouds and seeing myriads of differing visions. Anyway, Langdon's true insights on symbols are worth the price of admission.pefully, the movie will hold to that rich Mona Lisa atmosphere the book so promisingly begins with.

I am not a fanatic who wishes for &quot;all those who read this book to burn is hell&quot;, i do not practice that sort of vengeful hatred, i just pray that people who read this book, will not take the information on face-value.

But, I don't care about the factual validity to it because it *is* a fiction book. It looks to me that because he isn't the best writer, Dan Brown had to take (very) generous license to make everything to fall into place.What I care about is that it isn't even incredibly entertaining. It has an extremely formulaic approach and is filled with little 'puzzles' to solve throughout. Maybe it's just me, but I grew bored with puzzle-solving before I even hit high school, which worked out well because these puzzles seemed to be at junior high level in difficulty.His main character, Robert Langdon, has more knowledge of what is going on than the reader, which always feels like a cop-out on the author's part. If an author won't reveal to the reader what the character already knows, it's usually due to an attempt to keep the reader turning the page to find out the tidbits that are kept secret since the story won't retain their attention; this does work, but it never makes a good book.Dan Brown seems to excel in this technique and I must admit that I found his writing so mediocre that if it wasn't for my irrational desire to figure out certain plot points that Robert already knew and wouldn't tell us, then I would have stopped reading. A good book should be able to reveal everything to the reader that the main character knows and still keep the reader hooked, because otherwise, why bother telling Robert's story if the author's not even going to tell it?Also, I hate chapters that end with 'dun, dun, dun!' so you have to start the next chapter to see if the person really loses his or her head or if the hero really caught the bad guy only halfway through the book. Yet again, another writing stunt I thought I had left behind when I stopped reading Nancy Drew.I did like the historical sites sprinkled throughout, from museums to cathedrals to chapels; it was fascinating to learn about some places I've never heard of. Again, he took great license with the historical facts, but at least, because of my curiosity, it led me to do research on the locations and find out some interesting facts about medieval landmarks.The only reason I can figure that such a poorly written book is doing so well is because of all the publicity generated over the 'controversy.' The reason I picked up this book is because I bought into the 'everyone is doing it, so it must be good' mentality. My recommendation? Don't bother.to see if the person really loses his or her head or if the hero really caught the bad guy only halfway through the book.

The novel makes the reader alert because of its numerous intriguing details.  It tells the story of Robert Langdon, a Harvard profesor of symbolism, and Sophie Neveu, a police agent, who are chosen to solve a murder mystery and find the Holy Grail.  Sophie's grandfather is murdered in a museum and he leaves behind complex clues for Sophie and Langdon to find the Holy Grail.  Many plot twists occur, including secret societies, shocking religious information, and details about Sophie's family.  If you want a unique mystery novel filled with surprises, then Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is a perfect choice.",

The product he's peddling isn't invisible, it's just bad.The story begins in a deserted museum, where an elderly curator is being stalked by a huge (are you ready for this?) albino. That's right, like in the movie with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn. But he isn't your ordinary evil albino. This one also has a mysterious accent! The rest of the chapter reads like that novel Snoopy keeps trying to write, &quot;It was a dark and stormy night... .&quot;The dialogue is painful. The bad guys say things like, &quot;So, my pupil, tell me what I must know,&quot; and &quot;When we possess the keystone, we will be only one step away.&quot;To paraphrase those guys on Mystery Science Theatre 3000, this is a book that has EVERYTHING -- completely wrong. Plot, character, art, history. If &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; were a movie (and Ron Howard has threatened to make it one) it would be a perfect target for Mike Nelson and his robot friends.Weirdly, some major media outlets have lauded the author for the depth of his research. Taste is subjective, but facts aren't. Because of the endorsements Brown has received, a lot of readers will trust the book when it says things like, &quot;Jehovah&quot; comes from a root word that harkens back to goddess worship. Actually, Jehovah is a mistranslation of an ancient Hebrew word that scholars today render as Yahweh, which means &quot;I am that I am.&quot; Anyone who took a freshman course on Old Testament literature knows that.But Brown relentlessly mangles such facts in an effort to show that Jews and Christians are stupid, and that the Catholic leadership conspired to suppress the &quot;sacred feminine.&quot; He goes on to declare that church doorways and halls are really secret architectural symbols of vaginas. Have you ever been trapped in a conversation with someone who turns everything into a phallus symbol?

I looked up on the computer what was important to me, and am enjoying all the new information and theories. It will be a fun topic of discussion and debate with my friends who are Christians, Buddists, Athiests, Agnostic, etc.It is a novel, not a faith deciding textbook.

If that bothers you, then go read in the non-fiction department.Don't get me wrong, I am a Christain, and am very comfortable in my faith.

This is an excellent, compelling, intelligent thriller -- one that grabs you and doesn't let go until its final page. Robert Langdon is called in for questioning regarding a violent murder at the Lourvre one night. The clues left by the victim, the museum's curator, send Langdon and the victim's granddaughter, Sophie, on a quest to solve both the murder and the various clues the curator has left.

We learn that he has fallen victim to an albino monk called Silas working for the Opus Dei.  The Opus Dei (translates to God's Work) is a radical branch of the Catholic church that has been given blessing by the Vatican.  Opus Dei is headed by Bishop Manuel Aringanosa, Silas' mentor.  Sauniere had a meeting scheduled with Robert Langdon, an esteemed Harvard University professor of religious symbology.  Langdon becomes the prime suspect of Captain Bezu Fache, head of the Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire (French FBI), in Sauniere's murder.The learned Langdon suspects that Sauniere is the top man in the Priory of Sion, an ancient secret society and an offshoot of the Knights Templar entrusted with the keeping of the secrets of the Holy Grail.  As top man, Sauniere would be one of four men entrusted with the secret of the whereabouts of the Holy Grail.  Unfortunately the other three bearers of this precious secret have also been murdered on this night.Before his death Sauniere a talented cryptologist and expert of goddesses in religion left a series of clues to pass down the Priory secrets before they might be lost forever.

The story falls apart once the secret is revealed.The author makes no attempt to show how the secret actually resulted in power, wealth, or success, nor can one reasonably postulate how it could, if your goal is to keep the information secret. What would anyone in such a secret society have to gain by keeping such information secret, if it did not really lead to wealth or power?  The story would have at least made sense and would have been far more interesting if the secret were how to greatly prolong life, or how to generate wealth, or something that would reasonably explain the connection of wealth and power  with possessing the secret, and why someone would want to maintain the secret.  The reason for the society possessing so much power is totally absent.  The author also fails to support why someone would be motivated to murder to possess the secret.",

        "body": "Dan Brown proves that a little bit of heresy, a little bit of history and some imagination make for a intriguing story. This book is a good, amazingly quick read for its size. While historians and theologians would quickly point out that some of the theories, history and theology Brown is drawing on wasn't quite represented precisely -- that's not necessarily the point. Brown is exploring themes that are amazingly contemporary yet inextricably linked to controversial history.He certainly adds a unique, challenging and maybe accurate account in some ways. For example, a group like the Templars, Opus Dei, or a topic such as the historical Jesus have all managed to stir up their fair share of controversy in recent times.Unlike a more challenging title like &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ,&quot; the Da Vinci Code manages to build a fictitious world, and tackles these groups and issues in a less head-on way, making it less threatening to readers who may be uncomfortable with long, technical non-fiction books related to these topics and those who are unwilling to tackle Kazantztakis. Brown's world is decidely a work of fiction, making readers who are put off by his premises, comfortable enough to dismiss it as fiction.This book is a fun read, if even at times predictable. Some of the characters are a bit formulaic at times, but the overall plot of the book advances quickly enough that those are momentary bumps.The Da Vinci code also superbly manages to play with your mind along the way, challenging the reader to break codes and mysteries, most of which are not so complex to be frustrating or to be entirely implausible.",

Did I mention she works for the French version of the FBI?The book's premise is interesting - the true nature of the Holy Grail - but is far better suited to a history book than a thriller that feels like a rejected movie screenplay.The overly simplistic clues are especially frustrating.  One of Brown's more 'clever' puzzles is this one: an orb of 'rosy flesh and seeded womb' associated with a certain author of the laws of physics.  Oh, and it's a five-letter word.  It takes a Harvard professor several chapters to figure this one out?  Puh-leeze.  Where's the suspense in something the reader knows pages and pages ahead of what the author reveals?The anticlimactic ending is a complete letdown, since the story never deviated from my step-by-step predictions.

I have to admit the identity of the main culprit was rather surprising, but the ending left me a little disappointed.

        "title": "Leonardo in drag",
        "body": "Some of my fellow reviewers wrote that this was a book they couldn't put down. But once I started it and I did put it down, I found the book hard to pick up again -- my mind just filled with so many other things I'd rather be doing. About half way through I gave up the fight and didn't even try to start reading again.It isn't that the book is dense or difficult to read. To the contrary: I'd say that at first glance, author Dan Brown is a compelling storyteller, adept at seamlessly leading the reader from one scene to another. Sure, his constant foreshadowing is more often than not heavy handed, and some of the peripheral characters seem a little two-dimensional. But those are (unfortunately) common flaws and not the reason I was so displeased by the book.What really bothered me was how much Mr. Brown got wrong. The first example is the book's title: &quot;da Vinci&quot; isn't Leonardo's family name, it is a reference to his illegitimate father, which is a reference to the father's home town of Vinci, just west of Florence. In Italian, &quot;da Vinci&quot; just means &quot;from Vinci.&quot; No, Leonardo, like his contemporaries Raffaello and Giulio Romano, like Giotto, like Caravaggio, like Rembrandt ... like modern day Cher or Madonna, is correctly referred to by his given name. The book should have been called &quot;The Leonardo Code&quot; or &quot;The Leonardo da Vinci Code.&quot;Inside, there is more of the same. The author refers to some invented speculation that the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; is really a portrait of Leonardo himself in drag. Proof? Mr. Brown narrative says that computers show that key facial features are the same as those in contemporary portraits of Leonardo and that without this explanation the identity of the model is a mystery. The truth? No contemporary portraits of Leonardo exist, while the identity of the model in the famous painting is extremely well documented.There is more: Leonardo's &quot;Last Supper&quot; is not a fresco, as the book says. And the idea that Mary Magdalene somehow dressed up as a man and appears in the painting in lieu of one of the apostles is more than a little far fetched.I know that a novel cannot be taken as a historical document and that by definition, events are fictionalized in any work of fiction. But they have to be fictionalized in a context that is real or at least believable. If that doesn't happen, the structure of the story crumbles because we no longer know what means something and what doesn't. A more specific example: the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; carries with it certain information, who the subject was, what the painting means, who painted it, and its place in the West's cultural canon. Those factors are part of the package that simply cannot be jettisoned. If the author wanted a painting (or an artist) that didn't carry those exact meanings, then he would be better off selecting different subjects, or just making them up from scratch.If a novel set in modern times included a character who drove a '78 Ford Pinto, we could draw certain conclusions about him. Maybe he doesn't have much money, or he has a bad taste in cars, or he has been forced to use this unfortunate vehicle. But if the story is written so that the Pinto is candy apple red, that it attracts &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahhs&quot; from people who see it, and can race down the highway at 200 mph, then we scratch our heads. Why did the author call the car a Pinto? Wouldn't it be easier and better to have called it a Ferrari?When I first started to notice these kinds of incongruities in The Da Vinci Code, I wondered if they were early clues that Robert Langdon, the main protagonist, was a bit delusional, or at least too free and easy with the facts. But it didn't take long to understand that the one who was too free and easy with the facts was the author.a fresco, as the book says.

It is for curious, reasonably intelligent people who can admit that they know very little about Leonardo Da Vinci or religious history, even if they are well-educated in other subjects.  If this describes you, then 'The Da Vinci Code' may just blow your hair back, and hopefully entice you to go out and explore other (ahem, better, more well-researched) books on these topics.Brown does succeed in presenting ideas and theories most of us have never considered or even heard about, and it has the potential to challenge an average person's religious views and beliefs.  I found some of it downright fascinating, but as I told my father (who gave me the book), I wish he had simply written a nonfictional essay, outlining his various theses--however 'half-baked' they may seem to those religious scholars out there--in similarly simplistic language (ie. layman's terms) for those of us who are less knowledgeable but still fascinated.What I do admire about Brown as a writer is his ability to reach a large number of people from vastly different walks of life.  By veiling his sentiments (however thinly) in a popular fictional genre (however awkwardly), he has attempted (and succeeded, judging from the sheer number of reviews on Amazon.com) to 'spread the word'--a strange new gospel of Dan, if you will.  As a composer in a decidedly unpopular musical genre, I can appreciate that accomplishment for what it is.  Having said that, I cannot recommend 'The Da Vinci Code' as great fiction.  Read it if you love art but don't know it; read it if you are fascinated by religion but not religious; heck, read it if you are on vacation (I was) and you need a fun read at least two steps above Danielle Steele.  But most importantly (and I say this about most things in life, because nobody has the answers), read it with a grain of salt!  Ideas are just ideas, however dramatic, explosive, and offensive they may seem.  Think of this book as speculative cocktail conversation, with a few exaggerated Hitchcockian details thrown in for spice.  We all enjoy that from time to time.they may seem.

        "body": "I rarely read books with so much media hype surrounding them, but the premise of this book piqued my interest. As an art lover and a spiritual person, I was looking forward to an interesting read.I was incredibly disappointed.I hope no one finds offense in this next statement, but this book was written for the masses.  The writing is... obvious. No thinking required. It's a good book to take on vacation, or to read while on break from grad school, like I am. It is not an intellectual endeavor, by any means! With that said, it was certainly entertaining, and I'm wondering if the movie is already in the works. Robert Langdon is likened to Harrison Ford early in the story, and I don't think this was an accident. The reader is stuck with the mental image of Ford as Langdon. (not such a bad thing, of course, but it adds to the Hollywood movie feel of the book!)The potential in this book is endless, and I believe it could have been a masterpiece.  Sadly, the claims on the jacket are simply hype... Nelson DeMille claims the work of &quot;pure genius&quot; lies within the pages of this book, but I fail to see it!Every single symbol is explained and explained again, in case you forgot the first explanation. This certainly takes the fun out of symbolism, if you ask me. Every chapter is written with this cliffhanger, Hollywood-esque style, which keeps you turning pages in the beginning but gets tiresome after a while.I love the theories surrounding the Holy Grail and Mary Magdalene, and I find the beliefs in the sacred feminine incredibly intriguing. I find it funny when devout Roman Catholics denounce this fictional book as heresy... these closed-minded reviews just add to the controversy and help support opposing theories. In my opinion, Roman Catholicism is the nuttiest and most corrupt religion out there.  More people should examine the ancient beliefs in the sacred feminine, something that has been sadly eradicated from the Catholic Church. This idealogy is explored in The da Vinci Code, and I found the history quite interesting.One last thing, in response to some of the reviews I've read - it's difficult to take people's reviews seriously when they can't even keep the story straight. Sophie Neveu was Sauniere's granddaughter in the book, not his daughter, as I have read too many people say.  It's an important detail, as the reader finds at the very end of the story. Speaking of the end, that was my favorite part of the book. I saw it coming and was annoyed to have the writer present it as such an amazing revelation, but Sophie's reunion with her family members help tie the story together and add a little depth to otherwise incredibly shallow characters. The end was also my favorite part of the book because, well, I could finally stop reading it! Throughout the story, I kept waiting for Brown to redeem himself as a writer but it never happened.All in all, I feel it could have been a great book but it was mediocre at best. Some of the historical stories and symbols have grabbed my attention though, and I look forward to reading more about these intriguing topics.This idealogy is explored in The da Vinci Code, and I found the history quite interesting.

I enjoyed the individual characters (with the exception of Sophie--who was flat) and their independent personalities.",

There is the mystery of the past, the puzzles left by the victim found in the early pages, and the chase for our heros lives throughout the book.  The book takes us through the ages, in and out of the church, through cities and countries.  Rarely has a book so peaked my interest.

        "body": "After finishing the DaVinci Code, I have to say that this is one of the best novels that I have read in awhile.  After reading the first few pages, I quickly became engrossed in the story.  At its core, the plot is pretty basic, but the extra details and twists that are added in along the way, definately make this novel unique.  The DaVinci Code is written in a style that flows well and makes it easy to read, the author is able to write a realitively  complex plot without confusing the reader.  The chapters are pretty short and are written in several different points of view, that keep the story moving along, with out getting too repetitive.  The mini history lessons that accompany the plot are actualy quite interesting, and those alone make the book a worthwhile read.  The plot is interesting and enough to hold your attention, but around the end it does lose some of the excitement that it initialy had.  As for the characters, there definately are several unusual ones in the book, and I found the majority of them to be both realistic and interesting.  While the book isn't perfect, it is definately entertaining and teaches the reader quite a bit in the process.  In a way, it reminded me of the movie, The Ring in the sense that they Both started out as pretty basic plots, but along the way you see new details unfold, which transforms it into a much more complicated, and detailed story. The DaVinci code adds a new, more intelligent twist on the classic suspense novel.",

Now everyone and their mother has heard about The Davinci Code, and now I am not going to spoil it, but I am going to talk about some of the good points and bad points in this novel. The novel starts out with a murder by an albano man inside a Paris museum. Now Robert Landgon, a lecturer and a writer who wrote a novel based on Davici's paintings is then called in by the French police since he was supposed to be the last person to see Robert Landgon alive. So they take him to the murder scene, and a French dectective named Falis starts asking him questions about the murder, but what Robert does not know that he is considered a suspect in the murder of Jaques (the man who was murdered). So now comes in Sophie, a cryptologist which someone left a code, and she can not figure it out, but she has a hinch about it. So now, she tells Robert that they are tracking him and that they have him as a prime suspect. So now as a way to escape, Robert and Sophie throw out the GPS tracking device out the window into this passing truck, and the French Police go after of what they think is Landon. So now as they escape, things start to unravel in this tale. As they move forward, it turns out that Landon finds out that Sophie's grandfather Jaques (who was murdered) because he was in a secret society which they know where the holy grail rests! So now, they find this poem that links to where they can find the grail. Now, they head to the country side of France to a good friend of Robert's. He then tells him that in the secret society; Sir Issac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Leonarado DaVinci along with Sophie's grandfather Jaques. Sophie then figues out the code where her grandfather left her on the floor. It turns out that it is the bank code in this bank vault in a Swedish bank. So they get the rosewood box which would lead them to the holy grail. So now, as the story moves around, it gets good, but by the end, it just falls flat.I am not going to spoil the end because I want people to make their own decision. So if you want to read it, then read it, but read it with a open mind because some of the things in this book are going to think, and maybe even mad at Dan Brown for saying some things.

I disagree with previous reviewers: I think it is well-researched. There is an afterward, and alternative histories of Mary Magdalene's life have abounded for years. Dan Brown wasn't the first to give life to them, just one of the first to end up on the best seller list.I admit, as a former catholic school teacher, it did make me question exactly what the early Church had covered up. And that's exactly why it's so fascinating: could it be true? Could anyone ever prove it indefinitely? These questions are wrapped up in a tight plot that entertains as well as enlightens.I recommend this book to folks who want or need to escape from the world for a little while. And if it inspires anyone else to read a more academic book about the early Church, or DaVinci, or art history,  or the holy Grail, than all the better. For that reason alone, I think high schoolers would enjoy this book as well as adults.One note regarding the review about the inaccurate portrayal  of  Leonardo's LAST SUPPER. In The DaVinci Code, I thought the protagonist, the Harvard symbologist, made it clear that DaVinci was a bit of a prankster. Thus, it's entirely plausible that he would accurately label  the apostle to the right of Jesus as John, but also, keep the painting obtuse enough to also be plausibly Mary Magdalene. After all, in DaVinci's time, who would get away with portraying Mary Magdalene that way (which begs the question, would it be easy to get away with it now? ).",

        "title": "The DaVinci DeCoded",
        "body": "The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown is a good read for those who like their protagonists wearing panties.  Robert Langdon, the protagonist, is a Harvard professor of symbols who is uncomfortable around guns.  He teaches art to prison convicts on the weekends.  And when he makes his get away, he makes it in a SmartCar that gets '[a] hundred kilometers to the liter.'  (However, he has to pull over to let his female counterpart drive because he can't operate a standard transmission vehicle).  Mr. Langdon inhabits a strange world.  In his world, everyone seems to be a member of a mysterious secret society that is battling for the supremacy of their group's secret symbols.  The book's characters carry, protect and chase symbols across the globe because the power to control symbols is the power to control people like software controls a computer.  Our world isn't the world of Mr. Langdon.  Symbols of power hold little currency in today's world.  Science has educated the world that the forces of nature are not controlled by symbols and magic, which has made science the enemy of people like the environmentalist Unabomber, who tried to stop 'technology' by mailing bombs to universities.  In addition, free and open societies undermine the need for secret societies.  If there can be an organization that publicly advocates the molestation of children (NAMBLA), why would any organization need to be a secret society?  The Da Vinci Code contains a grand conspiracy.  What kind of conspiracy might a panty-wearing professor from Harvard believe in?  Something along these lines:  Mother Earth has been destroyed by masculinity and this attack against femininity has been led by the Catholic Church.  According to Langdon, the Catholic Church is the enemy of humanity because it is the official representative of the masculine.  Langdon doesn't mention of the Virgin Mary and how she is part of this conspiracy of men.  Is the Catholic Church this powerful?  Are they that opposed to women?  Are they that impotent against a few flamboyant artists?  This conspiracy began with the Roman Emperor Constantine.  Constantine pulled the lever from feminine to masculine and it has all been downhill since the fifth century, even though the book contradicts itself and says on the next page that the lever was pulled two thousand years ago.  The conspiracy actually suggests that when Constantine yanked the lever (so to speak) all the orthodox rabbis became men.  Does Langdon's assertion that Jews are controlled by the Vatican make this an anti-Semitic as well as an anti-Catholic novel?  This conspiracy seems as Christo-centric as it is anti-Christian.  The conspiracy suggest that in geographical areas not controlled by the Church and before Christianity began the world was inhabited by a single people with a single mind and culture that  worshipped femininity.  What about brutal non-Christian societies like the Samurais, Rome, Egypt and the Aztec's with their human sacrifices.  The Church isn't the cause of all of the problems in the world.  As my anthropologist professor once said, the theory of ancient humans has gone from assuming cavemen were brutes to assuming they sat around sipping white wine.  Langdon adds that they were politically correct liberals as well.  How does DaVinci fit in?  He's a homosexual who was opposed to the Church, according to Langdon.  DaVinci's famous Mona Lisa painting is a philosophical statement that makes the argument that the masculine and feminine forces in the world must be balanced, but in today's world the masculine force is in control.  Langdon, however doesn't seem interested in balancing feminine and masculine forces.  Langdon wants a world where feminine forces are in control.  If feminine forces were put in control everyone would worship something called the sacred feminine and participate in public fornication ceremonies.  Langdon is not looking for balance.  He's just looking to get laid.  This is a book in the code genre, which seems to be popular now, i.e. The Bible Code.  The prose is indistinguishable and the action doesn't pick up until the middle of the book.  This book tells a lot more than it shows.  Every action in the novel is stopped for a lecture on subjects ranging from pentagrams to cryptography and art.  The flashbacks may have a higher word count than the present day narrative, which takes place in Paris and London.  If this were a movie, the constant flashbacking would produce a film that looked like an editor splicing a documentary movie into an action film.  These little flashback lectures are the best part of the book and the little puzzles are clever, even if their power to suspend disbelief is weak.  If you read the novel as a brief educational course on symbols or are a member of the Priory of Sion, KKK or other anti-catholic organization you may enjoy this book.ust looking to get laid.

These little flashback lectures are the best part of the book and the little puzzles are clever, even if their power to suspend disbelief is weak.  If you read the novel as a brief educational course on symbols or are a member of the Priory of Sion, KKK or other anti-catholic organization you may enjoy this book.",

        "body": "Having been mildly interested in stories of the Holy Grail after a trip to Rosslyn Chapel in 1999, it was with great anticipation that I finally read THE DA VINCI CODE.  It did not disappointment me in the least.  One hallmark of a good book to me is that it makes me think and makes me read more about something I learned in the book.  I have already read two of the books mentioned in TDC (those in Teabing's library), and as a domino effect, have bought several others.  But this book is not a history book or a book on art appreciation although it does make it even more interesting if you are interested in those things.  It is a first-rate thriller.  I wasn't able to figure out the villain until it was revealed to the reader (having been totally wrong in who I had guessed it to be).  Of course the scenes at Rosslyn Chapel really came to life as I had remembered it.  My book group read this and I wholeheartedly recommend it as a book group selection. We had our best discussion ever, I shared photos of Rosslyn Chapel and Westminster Abbey while another member brought books she purchased at the Louvre.  I can't say enough good things about this book.  My husband read it right after I finished (right after he read Brown's ANGELS AND DEMONDS).  This book justly deserves all the attention it has been receiving and justly deserves its place on top of the bestseller lists.",

        "body": "This is a fun read with lots of puzzles, ciphers and references to art history, and I completely recommend it. My copy is making its way through my office. The only place where this book goes astray is when it tries to come up with a good conspiracy theory.  Suppression of the mother cult started long before Constantine (a good starting point is 'When God was a Woman' by Stone).  Constantine also probably got a good dose of Christianity from his mother, St. Helen. The Knights Templar were a threat to the consolidation of power of Philip IV of France not pope Clement V or the Catholic Church. In fact there was a power struggle between the two and Philip decided the 'Bishop of Rome' would be better quartered in Avigon France, under 'French protection'.  In fact the knights were tried in French courts, for religious crimes by an inquisitor who was excommunicated!  Something the pope objected to but Philip ignored.  Good sources are 'The Templars' by  Read and 'The Knights Templar: A New History' by Nicholson.  In 'The Templars and the Grail' Ralls points out that the trials were politically motivated and pretty much a kangaroo court.  Whenever the Templars were brought before the inquisitors they were acquitted except when brutally tortured.  Which meant everywhere in Europe except France and Naples (Charles II of Naples was Philip's uncle..go figure).  The outcome is the Templars were only guilty of supporting the church, defending pilgrams, being prosperous and being in Philips way. In an unusual act of defiance Clement transferred the Templar's holdings to the other religious orders primarily the Order of St. John (Knights Hospitallers) keeping them out of Philips hands. A lot of the myths and legends used in the book belong in the 'El Dorado' category but it lends an air of mystery to the work.  The work has a lot of the spirit of Umberto Eco but without the tedium and academic rigor and is a great summer read.",

It's classified as fiction, however, it certainly has some very valid points.  With the world situation as it is, it made this reader pause and think.I already have Angels & Demons sitting here ready to start.  A genius of an author with a unique twist on an old subject.

        "body": "Like every single other novel he wrote, Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is an over-the-top paranoid conspiracy thriller that's riddled with a poor plot and questionable &quot;research&quot;. All religious controversy aside, the main problem with this book is just the godawful clich&eacute;s that are everywhere. The unstoppable assassin (who despite being albino has no vision problems even though the lack of all pigments cause albinos to have bad vision), the forced romance, the ridiculous plot twist that's supposed to shock us all, but seems to lack reason, and inane puzzles. Additionally, the plot is rife with mere stupidity. How does someone dying of a gunshot wound manage to write a diagram and other various things on the floor? (It's rather like the scene from Monty Python And The Holy Grail with the Castle Aaarrrggghhh....) Why is it that the aforementioned dying character have the same last name as a priest who dabbled in the occult about 100 years ago (talk about obvious allusions)? Why do the main characters stop to look at a painting as they're being chased? Why are all the villains so stereotypically malicious without any motivation? Why does the villain do the old &quot;tell 'em everything before you kill them&quot; routine that's been in every single James Bond movie?Finally there's the whole religious issue. Obviously, Dan Brown has some issues with the Roman Catholic Church as evidenced by this book and his other work Angels &amp; Demons (which by the way is EXACTLY the same as this book), but that is not what bothers me. What bothers me is that he claims all he is written is true, when most of his sources are of questionable integrity and much of what he writes is apparently woefully inaccurate.To conclude, The Da Vinci Code is a formulaic thriller that only stands out due to its subject matter, which cannot save it from the woeful clich&eacute;s that pepper the novel. If you want a thriller based on fact, read The ODESSA File by Frederick Forsyth, or Spandau Phoenix by Greg Iles. These novels manage to combine fact and fiction and do not fail on such ridiculous clich&eacute;.pandau Phoenix by Greg Iles.

I read them both, and they are nothing more or less than a typical, mediocre &quot;summer beach novel&quot; that contains extensive lessons (can you say boring ?) on Catholicism...from the actual religious functions to the museums, art and the architectures that hold the art, and how the architectures that hold the art came about, and the architecs who built them, when they built them and what drew them to architecture in the first place, and how the art wound up in that particular architecture. etc. WHEW ! I don't even consider this man a good writer, but he's one heck of a  teacher who's obsessed with Catholicism and it's culture. Sure, he throws in a few bad guys...a little science.....a few gruesome murders...a secret society here and there, but his his paper-thin, cliched and utterly ridiculous stories are nothing but padding so he can write about his vast knowledge of all things Catholic (and expensive Catholic art). He never &quot;puts you there&quot; with his many long winded descriptions of his settings, he simply comes across as a teacher who's telling you what he learned or saw, and this becomes extremely boring and irritating to me. Before you deny this, think ! Consider the shallow and cliched stories of these two books, which possess one of the most monumentally cliched lead characters I've ever encountered .....now, consider the major lessons on Catholicism you were dealt....and how they make up the bulk of the book. Am I wrong ? If the reader finds this type of novel fun, thrilling, intelligent or informative, then that's great. But, I don't like all the media exclaiming &quot;masterpiece,&quot; &quot;absolutely stunning,&quot; &quot;the best of the best&quot; &quot;genius,&quot; etc., when this author is basically on par with James Patterson. Yep, that's right.

Also, after reading this book, there were so many other books I wanted to read because of the many genres Brown touches on -- the life of Da Vinci, art analyzation, scientific revolutionaries (Newton, for example), religions (pagan and Christianity), secret societies and so on.",

        "title": "Lots of Fun",
        "body": "With &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; Dan Brown reprises his last novel, &quot;Angels and Demons,&quot; by bringing back both his Robert Langdon character, and the fast and furious tone that make both books such thrilling reads. Let's be frank about this book. &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is not a great literary work. What it is is a LOT of fun to read.While less complex and demanding than &quot;Angels and Demons,&quot; this effort is no less enjoyable. The action starts with an early murder in Paris, and picks up speed after a brief and amusing scene involving Landon and a stereotypical French Chief Investigator. However, the reader soon learns the identity and motivation of the true murderer, after which the story transposes quickly into a rather cliche search for the Holy Grail, which is interesting, if not original. Brown didn't originate the ideas on which this story is based, and he doesn't claim credit for them. While they don't form the basis for a particularly believable story, Brown does successfully use them to generate a palpable sense of urgency around the story line, and that drives the reader from page to page in a flurry.The book reads quickly, and with immense satisfaction. I felt like Brown was leading me around with a carrot on a stick, just letting me get a little nibble here and there, while he unfolded chapter after chapter of this thriller. My only complaint is that I thought the ending wasn't particularly dramatic or satisfying enough for the plot: the climax just kind of fades away, instead of delivering the whole ending in a nice, wrapped-up package.In the end, the grail story is an apt subject for this book. In fact, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is quite an apt metaphor itself for the search for the Grail. Not so much as a murderer, Langdon and his co-protagonist, Sophie Neveu, are playing out a great scavenger hunt in search of the answers to some of life's greatest mysteries. And while Brown's themes of the Grail are far from mainstream, there's just enough of a hint of believability to draw the reader into the story and keep him there.The bottom line is that this book is fantastically fun to read. Don't look for anything else, here; this book doesn't need it. Don't critique it or analyze it. Buy it and read it just for fun. On that level, it scored five stars from me. I'll buy the next one from Brown, too. If you read this book, I'm guessing you may, as well.r from mainstream, there's just enough of a hint of believability to draw the reader into the story and keep him there.The bottom line is that this book is fantastically fun to read.

It's amazing.The story leaves you wanting more. I found myself staying up late just to see what happened next. It also was very thought provoking for me. I am a devout Catholic and it really opened my mind to new possibilities. There is so much out there that I have never been exposed to and this book helped me to realize that. I am going to read as much as I can now about the topic.You seriously need to buy this book. You will not be disappointed.",

She was absolutely right.If you like thrillers but aren't into alternative religious studies, you will still like this book. &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; is so strong as an adventure story, you don't have to be into any of the main characters' favorite subjects to enjoy it.It does help, however, to be interested by the mental twists and turns of the conspiracy theories, obscure history and anti-establishment viewpoints expressed here. It also helps to have a good vocabulary or a good dictionary -- the main characters are all academics, and they speak and think as such.In a nutshell, this book is a great ride for the nerdier crowd, but still plenty adventurous enough for the regular thriller reader to stay tuned in.",

The way Dan Brown blends fact with fiction so brilliantly keeps the reader turning the pages and wanting to know what happens next. The reader is constantly thrown off center when he or she realizes that the way things appear never really is what it seems to be. The action, the betrayal, the sheer drama keeps the reader begging for more with every chapter. The way Dan Brown suddenly makes obviously clear the riddles that seem impossible at first glance force the reader to look at every riddle with a keen eye in order to look beyond what initially seems to be is absolutely ingenious. If you have not yet read this book, you must read it as soon as possible. Dan Brown has done more than just hit a home run with this novel. Fact and fiction come together masterfully in this marvel of a novel. Go out and buy The Da Vinci Code today!",

I firmly believe that Dan Brown intended to subvert the Christian masses with his impeccably researched book of pure fact that cannot be challenged by the greatest historians of any age. This book, no let's refer to it as a Bible from now on, this Bible, who's content may not be called into question, should be taught along side the creation theory in all school across the US. Which by the way is ruled by the superior intelligence of our greatest of all Presidents George W. Bush A.K.A. God mark II.Do not question my authority and my God given power to judge all others as scum. I am next in line to rule the earth after God mark II is done with it. Though there won't be anything left I will still have my copy of the Jebus Bible in one hand and the Dan Brown Bible in the other. So it is written so it is done.",

I'm not a big believer in conspiracies...do you know any group of people who can keep a secret? To say that Christianity is flawed because an artist believed Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had a child...then to go on and talk about gods &amp; goddesses, the age of pisces and aquarious...I found this so contradictory.

        "body": "Through a very ingenious mystery plot, Dan Brown tries to present  the complex roots of modern Christianity.  The book makes one wonder why women were cast out of most modern religions, so it is not the &quot;normal&quot; dogma that we are used to, and may explain some of the more negative &amp; emotional reviews.Contrary to those reviews, this book is NOT an anti-religion tome.  It celebrates and is very respectful of human spirituality, in all its forms.  It tries to explain, in a historical context, how religions came to be what they are today.The end is particularly wonderful, with a final analysis that should leave everyone feeling good about their beliefs, whatever they are.BUT, let me emphasize, The Da Vinci Code it isn't *just* about religion -- it is also a thrilling detective story.  Despite a great opening page, I do agree that the beginning is just a tiny bit slow, but is more than compensated for, later on.It is so well written, that I could not figure out who the &quot;bad guy&quot; was even at the very end!  Dan Brown weaves a twisting and turning plot that finishes elegantly, without lowering itself to explaining a bunch of loose ends, in the final chapter!I can't wait for the movie to come out!",

Brown has written an engrossing novel, but his style is more pulp than poetic, and the characters, for all their collective expertise,  are a bit slow on the uptake.  That said, I really enjoyed the book, and it's nice to see the Goddess get her due on the New York Times Best Seller list.",

However, he may just contain those qualties that are conspicuous in the writers of prime time television shows, and action movies. The novel does entertain, and also contains some interesting historical facts, but the writing style, or lack of it, is what leaves me with a negative impression.  I did give it three stars because I think Brown created exactly what he wanted in this novel.  What we are left with is a very marketable book, with few memorable qualities... similar to much of our pop culture. But if you can understand what I mean when I say that Scarface was a better movie and Coetzee's 'Disgrace' was a better book, you might also understand why the DaVinci code is really not worth the time.",

The discovery is hailed as the find of the millenium.  Some proclaim that it will change history as we know it.Sound silly? Of course, yet this is what Elaine Pagel and now Dan Brown have attempted their assertions, based on the so called 'Gnostic gospels', concerning the origins of the Catholic Church, the 'sacred' feminine and the divinity of Christ.It has been said that history is written by the winners.  That might be true, but how true would history written by the non-winners be?  The Gnostics were a group of folks alienated from the mainstream.  Many scholars have described their writings as the tabloid press of the day. If you read the actual writings you will discover they are incredibly strange, nonfeminist and down right antisocial.        As far as the clues in The Last Supper,  it was common for Leonardo to paint young men in an effeminate manner.  Ther is at least one other portrait of St.John, by Leonardo that looks equally as feminine.Regardless of the historical problems with this conspiracy the writing is subpar at best, merely a means by which Brown can take advantage of current anti-Catholic sentiment.I understand that Ron Howard is turning this into a movie.  As a screenplay it might work.",

Critics of this book either site anti-Christianity or factual inconsistencies. However, I think that such criticisms miss the point. The DaVinci code IS fiction based around facts - facts not commonly known to most. Many of these facts are easy to verify. There is a Priory of Sion. There is an Opus Dei. There is controversy surrounding the Holy Grail. Discrediting Dan Brown's novel by comments related to the use of 'DaVinci' instead of Leonardo's real name is ludicrous.  Dan Brown has a well-researched and suspenseful thriller that is hard to put down. Simply put, it is brilliant.Approach this book with an open mind and chances are you will enjoy it like so many others.",

The intriguing settings of Paris and London make for an ideal backdrop for this well-crafted tale(it is fiction people) that you can't put down.  This is one of those rare books that will keep you up at night reading - as opposed to serving as a cure for insomnia.Si vous pouvez parler francais, c'est tres utile pour ce livre.  If you can't(speak French, that is), then a French-English dictionary would be of use when reading The Da Vinci Code, which, at times, uses French without translation.  The characters are well designed, yet mysterious - which lends itself to the making of a great mystery.  Not only are you trying to figure out the identity of the murderer(it happens on page 1 so I'm not giving anything away here), you also find yourself deeply ensconced in the quest for the historical truth of, among other things, Mary Magdalene, Jesus, Da Vinci, The Holy Grail, Opus Dei, The Vatican, and most inscrutably, The Priory of Sion.  While this is fiction, it will invariably raise some eyebrows in any circle.  Read it yourself and be your own judge.",

Author Brown would have been far better served to have written a direct treatise on the facts as they exist rather than try to string them all together via a plot line which, for the most part, was trite and forced.

Would you just get to the murder and stop telling us that three Eiffel Towers laid on their side equals . . .

Because the albino villain (and fear not, Brown will stop his story, just as I am stopping mine to explain the origin of the word, villain) went to the murder scene intending to commit murder with only one bullet in the clip of his pistol. That was so he could shoot his victim only once in the stomach and not use the second shot to the head to finish him. Because if he finished him, the guy wouldn't have time to leave behind all his clues for the arrogant hero to find. Please. Not another Dan Brown story in which every major plot point turns on the stupidity of a major character. (Digital Fortress was another one.

Are the Freemasons protecting a secret the Knights discovered while they drive around in gocarts wearing fez hats at a 4th of July parade?  Or just hooey?  Read Eco's Foucalt's Pendulum and really delve into multiple, head-spinning conspiracies head first.  Conspiracies that dry up when discovered because of the twisted logic of the believers.

        "title": "Okay, I have read the novel and here is what I think...",
        "body": "In the &quot;Poetics,&quot; his famous study of Greek dramatic art, Aristotle compares tragedy to such other metrical forms as comedy and epic poetry. He argues that tragedy, like all poetry, is a kind of imitation (mimesis), but adds that it has a serious purpose and uses direct action rather than narrative to achieve its ends. Aristotle holds that poetic mimesis is imitation of things as they could be, not as they are (i.e., of universals and ideals). Consequently, poetry--that is to say, all literature--is a more philosophical and exalted medium than history, which merely records what actually happened.  Aristotle was defending poetry as much as explaining it because there were those in ancient Greece who were deeply offended that anyone should create works of fiction.That would seem to explain some of the reaction to Dan Brown's bestseller, &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; that has enraged many theologians who have denounced it as anti-Catholic.  Brown takes some credible theories about the early Christians, mines the paintings of Leonardo for helpful symbolism, and creates a series of codes left behind by a dying man, to create a thriller with Biblical implications.  However, along the way there is a consistent and compelling critique, not so much of the Catholic Church of today, but of the early history of Christianity.  The person who takes the biggest drubbing in the book is not the Pope (either one of them that figure in the story), but the Emperor Constantine.  The idea that &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; constitutes a revisionist view of Christianity is pretty ironic since it was Paul's transformation of the teachings of Jesus into something more palatable for the Gentiles of the Roman Empire, the history of Christianity has been one of transformation.The big question then becomes whether or not &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a theological argument dressed up as a mystery that should have been advanced as a scholarly treatise.  The position that Christianity fueled a patriarchal society at the expense of Mother Earth permeates the novel, but ultimately it is part of the rationale for solving the mystery, existing more as a function of narrative than a rhetorical stance.  Then again, I have no problem with the idea that Jesus will always be an important historical figure, regardless of what information might be discovered or revealed in the future.  By the same token, speculation about a possible marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene does nothing to distract from the power of his ministry.  On the other hand, I fully realize that such a position will be regarded by a great many as heresy, so I grant that the very premise of Brown's novel will be considered offensive by a great many people.  All I can offer in response is the belief that Brown was not intending to challenge such beliefs, but wanted to take some interesting ideas and creatively filling some gaps to make a compelling mystery.  The key supporting evidence for this idea would be that most of the key characters take all of this for granted, so that they are always explaining rather than advocating these various ideas.Of course, there will be those who are disappointed to find out that everything in this fictional novel is not true and who will be upset that this is indeed a work of fiction.  But so what if Leonardo Da Vinci did not hide clues about church secrets in his paintings?  All Brown needs is a willing suspension of disbelief on the part of his readers (which may be another reason that true believers are grossly offended by the theological &quot;politics&quot; of this novel); from the perspective of symbolists you can &quot;find&quot; lots of things in any artwork from Da Vinci to Degas to Dali to Dr. Seuss.  The idea that that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute is a potent one because it speaks to the power of redemption, where even a fallen woman can be saved.  Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion are real organizations, but unless you were well vested in such things it would not have mattered if Brown had made up names for the two groups.  But clearly Brown wanted to keep his story as close to the real world as possible, for obvious reasons.  If you want to separate the truth from fiction with &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; then just wait patiently: I am sure several books claiming to do just that will be published in 2004 (and all of them together will probably sell one-tenth as many copies as Brown's novel).  It would especially be nice to have a book that collects images of all the works of art and places that are so pivotal in the novel.&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a quick and engaging read, where the storytelling matters more than the writing, especially when we are involved in breaking the various codes and making the pieces fit.  Actually, I was rather surprised that the cast of characters remained rather small, but the scope of the conspiracy has historical depth rather than contemporary breadth (turning the novel into a screenplay is not going to be difficult: i.e., no characters of subplots have to be eliminated).  The characters exist to play the games, solve the riddles, and break the codes because very few readers are going to have a chance to do any of that.  I know that Da Vinci wrote backwards in his notebooks and that there are strong similarities between the face of the Mona Lisa and Da Vinci's self portrait, so I was ahead of the curve on a few points, but overall I was just along for the ride (I also knew a bit from playing &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot;).  The ending made sense to me from both a narrative standpoint, especially in terms of what ending you could hope to get away with in the context of keeping the story as &quot;real&quot; as possible.  But there is also the attendant irony, given the controversy over the book's &quot;attack&quot; on the Chruch, that the ending constitutes more of a matter of faith.ss you were well vested in such things it would not have mattered if Brown had made up names for the two groups.

The church is called misogynist and essentially conspiratorial, having a long-term agenda of suppressing women. The account of Eve's sin is mentioned as an anti-female thing. This conveniently ignores the fact that Adam is also listed in the Bible as the original sinner. All positive references to women in Scripture are conveniently ignored in this tendentious book. And strange how it is that, for a supposedly misogynist religion out to make females out to be malevolent beings, Christianity does not portray Satan as a female entity. The book also repeats long-discredited feminist myths of a onetime peaceful world under the Mother Goddess. In fact, as far back as archeology can show, violence was universal. A 'golden age' of peaceful matriarchy (that was supposed to have preceded the big, bad patriarchial Christian church) never existed.   The book makes transparently false and silly statements about the Gnostic 'Gospels', the Biblical Canon, Constantine, the Council of Nicea, etc. In terms of historical accuracy, the book is worthless. This book is just the latest anti-Christian fad, belonging in the same genre as Allegro's THE MUSHROOM AND THE CROSS and Schoenfeld's THE PASSOVER PLOT. Finding 'hidden messages' in DaVinci's works is pure fantasy, on par with Von Daniken's wacko notions (e. g., CHARIOTS OF THE GODS) of past extraterrestrial visitors to Earth that he imagines in Scripture and in ancient architecture.   I am surprised that such a shoddy book could have been so acclaimed and have become a bestseller. On second thought, I am not. After all, Christianity is the only religion that can be safely maligned in this politically correct age. And knowledge of the nature and history of Christianity is almost nonexistent among both Christians and non-Christians. Many people want their ears tickled, and this is all that this book does. In fact, it is nothing but rehashed anti-Christian feminist fantasies-the same stuff that's been around since at least the 1960's.  ",

I have not studied the Priory of Sion or Opus Dei extensively, but the obnoxious 'FACT' page at the beginning of the book poses the question of just how and why Dan Brown is privy to all of these secrets of the Catholic church, and the alleged sexual rituals of Sion, among other things. If he would cite his sources when he occasionally stumbled upon a fact or two and used some other form of notation when he let his imagination get the best of him, the book would be slightly more credible.  In addition to the questionable credibility of the CODE, it was embarrassing to read Brown's attempt at dialouge, particularly when he was discussing advanced symbolism with his college students as well as the college inmates. I cringed as Brown's writing was immediately reduced to that of a small child, as every revelation Langdon the symbologist came to was greeted by astonishment by his various 'classes'. The situation was similar as Langdon and Teabing, the wealthy protector of the seekers of the holy grail, informed Sophie, Langdon's accomplice, about the grail, and I found it difficult to maintain my composure during these particularly painful passages.  It is interesting that out of all the books on the market, the public has chosen to embrace this one.",

        "body": "In the book, Brown does give some interesting artistic information, particularly about da Vinci's 'Last Supper' painting that was commissioned for the Dominicans (Order of Preachers).  As Brown states, it COULD be Mary Magdalene sitting next to Jesus on the left as one faces the picture.  Mary Magdalene happens to be the patroness of the Dominican Order.  She is regarded as the first 'apostle' since she was the first to see Jesus after His resurrection and go tell the other apostles about it as instructed by Jesus. The face is definitely feminine and not masculine. I do not believe Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married as Brown opines since the Gospels never mention it.  In fact, celibacy is praised by the Lord for the 'sake of the Kingdom' and St. Paul does the same in his first letter to the Corinthians (7: 25-28), and NOT because human sexuality is 'evil'-that would be a very anti-Jewish concept!  And Jesus was a Jew.  It was also believed that Jesus was going to return imminently so why get married?  Jesus said that there was 'no marriage or giving in marriage in Heaven': we will be like the 'angels' (Matthew 22: 29-32).In the Gospel of John, Judas left the Last Supper early when it was 'night.'  So there are still 13 persons at the table in da Vinci's painting. This Gospel doesn't record a consecration/communion scene like the other three Gospels, however). Jesus' Body and Blood are discussed in the sixth chapter of John's Gospel. John is actually reclining on Jesus' chest because Peter tells John to ask the Lord who the betrayer is (also in the Gospel of John).  In the painting, then, John is close to Jesus' right.In discussing the 'sacred feminine' author Brown completely ignores Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Why?  She is certainly the most popular woman in the Gospels and in Christianity to this very day!  The most popular devotion is the 'Rosary' in Catholicism (coming from the word 'ROSE') which have 'mysteries' recounting certain pivotal events in the lives of Jesus and Mary that one meditates on while praying.  Praying the Rosary is a devotion that did not originate with the Dominican Order but subsequently was taken up by the Order as a devotional practice and used in preaching as well.The Virgin Birth?  Why so difficult to believe?  God creates all persons: if Jesus was the Son of God (the Father) the egg (of Mary) would have to be fertilized by the 'Holy Spirit.'  God can't do this?  This is no more a miracle than each of us are!  Does one make one's own body or any part thereof? Jesus had to be divine as well as human in order to effect our salvation.in the lives of Jesus and Mary that one meditates on while praying.

Along with its poor writing style, lack of essential argument, forced plot development, flat dialogue, absence of character development, and the lukewarm, impressively non-intelligent ending, the book manipulates the reader into believing that the author's references to history, art, geography and religion are facts and not his subjective interpretation or 'poetic license' for the purpose of writing a mediocre novel. The inaccuracies are too many to count but the author makes no effort to remind the reader that his facts are, in fact, fiction. Instead, he provides a page titled 'Fact' at the very beginning of the book as a priori confirmation that the ensuing narrative contains facts. This is dangerous for the uninformed readers. The author seems to use the same method on his readers that he accuses the church of having applied for centuries on the gullible folk to control and extort their faith, loyalty and money.",

That, I think, is one of this book's greatest strengths.  Readers who want to read this as a straight thriller will not be disappointed at all.  However, those who want to delve deeply into the mysteries of 'The DaVinci Code' will find plenty of material to pore over.This book is a spectacular, command, virtuoso performance by an author who knows how to educate while bringing readers to the edge of their seats.

I gave it three stars for the info alone. I also agree with the Eco quote in another comment. A similar one is the Law of Fives. The Law of Fives states simply that: All things happen in Fives, or are divisible by or are multiples of Five, or are somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to 5.  substitute Mary M.  for Five and you've got the da vinci code.",

The characters are wooden (the reluctant professor, the feminine but strong young woman, the evil conspirator, etc). In addition, the writer, so confident of his own cleverness, uses the same puzzles over and over again.  There is some interesting word play, as the characters solve a puzzle left for them by the enigmatic dead man.  But the writer makes use of the same puzzles in repitition until the reader is skimming pages quickly to get to the next new revelation.In some senses this book is a page turner-- because the premise is engaging, the reader does want to know the answers. Its just that the ride along the way is so annoying, and the characterizations are so rushed.One final problem with this book is the number of art history errors it contains!  For example, a Da Vinci painting which dramatically &quot;bends&quot; around the body of one character is actually painted on wood!  A good researcher would never have made this mistake.  There are legions of these little errors, which art historians have gleefully pointed out in many newspaper articles since this book's publication.",

There are very modest amounts of real scholastic effort here, simply presented, about the Knights Templar and so on. The writing is remarkably flat in tone: reminiscent of, say, Adam Hall's Quiller novels. I can see how readers who come to this material fresh are fascinated, but having read the aforementioned Eco novel (and others with similar material), I found this effort pretty thin gruel in comparison. Despite the author's best efforts, this is a straightforward thriller (almost a procedural), with fairly flat characters. You won't care all that much about anyone here and you won't find the really deep mysterious material that others (especially Eco) explore elsewhere to better effect.I guess I enjoyed the book, but only as a temporary diversion. Wait for the paperback: you'll read this novel in a couple of sittings and, if you're like me, will want something with more substance. In particular, the Bad Guys and the New Age Goddess vs. the Pope stuff is so rote as to be a parody of itself. Look for this one at your local Cineplex Oderama soon.",

Dan Brown creates believable characters stuck in extraordinary situations that strain credibility at times, but like 17th C French neoclassic playwrights, he keeps the 'unities' of time, action, and place realistic enough to sustain our interest.  The action starts right from the prologue, when Sauniere, a curator at the Louvre, is murdered by a mysterious albino 'monk'.  Realizing that an important secret will die with him, Sauniere stages his own death scene full of clues to the reason behind his murder.  This brings Robert Langdon, a symbologist, into the picture: first a suspect in the murder, then the only man who can truly solve it, Langdon finds himself fleeing through Paris and beyond to solve the clues and exonerate himself.  Langdon is joined by Sophie Neveu, who is revealed to be the granddaughter of Sauniere, and is herself a cryptologist.  The fun of the novel is watching the characters figure out the clues left by Sauniere, a master puzzler in more ways than one.  The big 'secret' everyone -- good and bad -- wishes to find is based in current theological debates on the nature of Christianity and the role of women in the church.  Although the end seems a bit rushed and almost too neat (intellectually, not emotionally), this is truly a 'I can't put it down' novel.  Definitely worth reading.",

I can barely sputter two words while on the tread mill but it is nice to know that a cryptanalyst and a university professor are so much more fit than I.

The truth is most early Church fathers were in agreement, this book takes a small minority opinion that was considered a hearsay at the time and makes it the dominate belief at the time. That is horrible scholarship. Most of Browns theories are not from the early church traditions, as I just sated he took a semi early heresy; but he gathered most of his information from the middle ages, when the knights Templars came up with he holy blood line BS. Really this is a rehash of a rehash, holy blood holy grail also did the same thing 20 years ago. It would be better if people sake the truth. One good way would be to read the new testament, The Apostle Paul's epistles totally blow Brown out of the water; Read the Lost Shipwreck of Paul for a great Historical book.

        "title": "Debunking the Code",
        "body": "Am I the only reader on this planet who does not think Dan Brown's &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is a wonderful book?  Who thinks, in fact that it is a rather bad book?  Badgered by any number of friends who consider themselves serious readers, I finally broke down and read it myself.  I was underwhelmed.For starters, I don't appreciate lectures in suspense thrillers.  Brown continually interrupts the story to drone on about the history of Paris or London, and, more verbosely, the &quot;history&quot; on which the story is based.  Entire chunks of the book read like a tarted up Michelin guide.Deep into the novel Brown briefly acknowledges his debt to a few religious &quot;history&quot; books, most of which assert claims seriously questioned by scholars.  Presumably Brown wants to assure his readers that he is not making all this stuff up, and that he has spent many tedious hours unearthing this arcane knowledge.  Actually all these books have been available to the public for years.  Evidently relying on the public's short attention span (or impatience with any book containing footnotes), Brown announces all his &quot;revelations&quot; in breathless prose suggesting hot-off-the-press news.Briefly, its main premise is that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, they had a child, or children, and their descendants are alive in France today.  This knowledge is protected by an ancient secret society, the Priory of Sion, loathed by the Vatican for obvious reasons.  One of the Priory's Grand Master's was Leonardo da Vinci.  Great stuff, thought Brown.  The making of a terrific thriller.But wait.  I keep calling &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; a thriller.  True enough, it offers a lot of what thrillers these days strut: cool cars, private planes, luxurious digs, fancy gadgetry, narrow escapes, etc.  The dust jacket, however, announces itself as a novel.  Well, the reader will look in vain for the usual hallmarks of a good novel, namely, well-developed characters in whom the reader takes an interest, and well-turned prose testifying to the author's passion for the language.  I couldn't have cared less what happened to the inane protagonists.  Their conversations are part comic book, part encyclopedia entry, and their adventures are told in a curiously flat, dull style reminiscent of a weather report.Perhaps I wouldn't be so annoyed by this book if it didn't exude such ambitious pretensions.  I caught Brown on a TV talk show, and it seems the man really thinks he has struck a blow for feminist theology.  That's a claim about as ridiculous as the assertion that the James Bond Series is an eloquent plea for democracy.I have no doubt that Brown wrote &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; with the intention of selling the movie rights.  He is already imagining the cast -- Langdon, the main character, is described as &quot;Harrison Ford in Harris tweed.&quot;  Well, doubtless the movie will be better than the book.  I can't envision any actor agreeing to interrupt an adventure to spout a lot of dubious scholarship, or worse, fatuous art criticism.But I pity the script writers.n whom the reader takes an interest, and well-turned prose testifying to the author's passion for the language.

When I first read all the reviews, I thought this might the book of the decade or something.I'm not going to spend time debunking the facts vs. fiction or whether I believe any of what is stated in the book... smarter, more well-read people than myself have done so at great length. However, I am a writer, and so I'll base my opinion the quality of writing, storytelling, plot, foreshadowing, and the like.I could forgive lack of character depth if the writing itself was tight (M. Crichton is the best at that), but its not. There were so many flashback's I often forgot where we were in the story. I still don't know anything about the characters even after finishing the book. Everything about them is told, nothing is shown. It's like being spoon fed pre-digested food; your brain never has to work at understanding them.Part of the problem with writing about secret societies is, well, they're secret. So witholding information in a mystery-like fashion is a bit unecessary... since the vast majority of the readers wouldn't know the first thing about them.Over all, the plot is interesting, but the story is abysmal. When they were on the plane and whats-his-face kept flashing back to his lectures, I actually decided I wasn't going to listen anymore. It was as if Mr. Brown had done all this research, put it in order, then tied it together with a couple of lame characters and then sent it to his editor. But I plodded on, hoping it would become better. I mean, come on, 80% of this book takes place either riding in cars or riding on planes... who would call that exciting?Anyway, I'm probably being a bit over critical, but I've tried for years to break into the 'published' world, and I can tell you if you weren't Dan Brown and this was your first novel, they'd laugh you out of their offices.oh well...",

        "body": "Dan Brown's 'The DaVinci Code' has been atop the bestseller list for 40 some weeks.  The 'fiction' list.  And the surest way to reach the top of the bestseller lists is to write for the lowest common denominator (in the sports world read: NASCAR) which in this case means - the mystery hound.  The DaVinci Code's appeal is that it is Grisham, Turow, or even JK Rowling, yet  with a religious twist.  Every chapter ends with a pointed gun.  Come to think of it, isn't this how Frank and Joe Hardy move through life?  Solve one riddle, and up pops another.  Everything is life-threatening, world-ending, but avoided by sheer pluck of the hero and heroine.  Turn the page, please.The hook is set on the frontispiece, 'Fact:'  We're in for a duel between the Priory of Sion - a secret society founded in medieval Europe (presumably still alive even in suburban Long Island according to the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut' movie), and the countervailing forces of Opus Dei, a devout Catholic sect to whom the Vatican is beholden.  Immediately, on page one, a murder takes place under the watchful eyes of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre.  So, right away we know we are going to learn more about art and architecture in the next 450 pages than we do about the columns of Mississippi courthouses in a John Grisham  novel.The plot is all go-go, and we're off quickly on a goosechase through Europe, ('mais Versailles, ce n'est pas nord-ouest du Paris, je pense, Monsieur Brun') replete with art, history, symbology and architectural lessons that qualify readers for a minor in liberal arts by book's end.  Papal conspiracies, self-flagilating monks, the obligatory sex ceremonies, hidden gospels, unbreakable ciphers...all the trappings of a first-rate page turner.You have to read it, just to be current, and to fend off all the loonies on either side who scream 'Heresey!' or 'Truth!'  I borrowed my copy from the library, but getting your paperback investment sandy at the beach this summer will be well worth it.ill be well worth it.",

It takes some truth, adds suspense and fiction, to make a fun book.  This book is based in fact, while the pieces are true and may not add up to be a whole truth, it never claims to. It is true that experts critique the book because of it's factual mistakes, however, the book has got people interested. It has taken hold of the public and sparked people to look into the truth.  Everything in today's society is critiqued and made fun of, just look at the late night television. This book is no different, except that it challanges the majority religion.  Just like the movie Stigmata this book raises important questions and convinces people to look more closly at their own religion instead of accepting the dogma that is handed out. The Lord may be our Shepard, but that doesn't mean we have to be sheep and have no brains of our own.  Anything that challanges the popular view is going to come in for criticism, Galileo is great example. Instead of looking at this book as a theory, people really need to look at it how it was intended: as a work of fiction loosly based on truth.

Dan Brown has taken the claims of Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln's Holy Blood, Holy Grail and made them into a murder mystery novel, full of codes, enigmatic verse, and tales of the Priory of Sion, Knights Templar, and the bloodline of Jesus. It's an entertaining quick read which may also stimulate further research into some of these claims. (For the record, I think the notion that Jesus was married is somewhat plausible, but not substantiated; the stories of the Priory of Sion being carriers of Jesus' bloodline almost certainly false; the stories of an ancient time of peaceful pagan goddess worship are probably bogus--Brown seems to be relying on Riane Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade, a work of pseudohistory.)",

        "title": "Shamefully Shoddy Scholarship Presented as Fact",
        "body": "Dan Brown masterfully does many things. First of all, he proves himself to be a precocious student of the post-Christian literary school and a keen observer of neo-Gnostic tendencies in the reading public. With virtually unparalleled deftness, he weaves together a plot that caters perfectly to this intended audience: flat characters (because people want this book to be a simple read), an obsession with the occult and conspiracy (facilitates desperately sought-after escapism), and high adventure (in the cast of Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider). Secondly, he panders to a theory of the 'sacred feminine' that has been en vogue since the publication of The Gnostic Gospels in 1979, giving it a flair of realism unachieved in earlier works. Unfortunately, Brown's skills stop there--in a mirage of realism. At a very superficial level, this mirage of realism can be seen in the quality of his prose. While Brown's description of sweeping landscapes and pulsating action at first can leave a reader benumbed, a close reading of the text reveals its lack of depth. Rightfully has the text been bemoaned as 'uninspiring' and 'flat'. Correctly, also, has the logic ostensibly holding the story together been lambasted as 'bordering on non sequitur'. This mirage of writing adroitness is the least of Brown's concerns, however. What wrenches any shred of legitimacy or hint of true scholarship from the text is the porous nature of its presented facts. Time and again, Brown shows a complete ignorance of basic art, historical, and literary facts. Indeed, it is rare to find a single substantiated claim in his supposedly 'meticulously-researched' work. While this may be attributed to the scope and ambitiousness of the topics covered, such attribution can scarcely defend the rampant incongruity between Brown's assertions and universally established and historically-corroborated facts. To mention but a few of the grotesque errors and outright fabrications that form the very foundation for his plot would result in a book review almost as long as Brown's tome itself. As such, I have chosen to forego enumerating even the most salient of these in this review. In doing so, I imitate Brown's own style of poor citation. However, unlike Brown, I herein give the readers access to primary sources to demonstrate his shoddy scholarship. For the true historian, philosopher, student, and anyone else open-mindedly in pursuit of historical truth, I suggest reference to all of the links that can be found at the bottom of this review. Please note that the following links represent a broad spectrum of theological and political viewpoints. I have intentionally done this so as to lessen the probability of institutional revisionism. To the same end, I have favored secular sources over religious ones.

        "title": "Fun read, but for the \ufffdAlbino\ufffd monk",
        "body": "For the most part, I enjoyed this book; and you can read many other helpful reviews that supply more detail about this book than I will in this review.  The main purpose for my review is to point out what I consider to be Brown's almost 'hate-literature'-like portrayal of a person with albinism.  In his character Silas, the Opus Dei monk who is also an assassin, Brown perpetuates a long-standing literary stereotype of albinism as associated with evil. (Please look up Luna Eterna's Albinism in Literature web page.)  Brown describes this character with a visually demoniac appearance, endowing him with the rarer red-eyed form of albinism.  Real people with this form of albinism do not, in fact, look demonic at all.  (Please see the work of photographer Rick Guidotti and his Positive Exposure project which originally ran in Life Magazine a few years ago and has now grown into a movement to encourage the acceptance of difference.  You can find out more on the web,)  Brown also seems not to have done his homework: people with albinism connot see well enough to shoot a gun accurately and the vast majority cannot drive a car.  This is because, as a direct result of the pigment disorder, there is not enough pigment in the retinas of the eyes; therefore people with albinism have severely limited eyesight that cannot be corrected.  I found I had a very hard time suspending my disbelief when, for example, at the beginning of the book in the Louvre, Silas was able to shoot the museum's curator at a distance of 15 feet and hit his target with pinpoint accuracy.  So, I give this book only 3 stars because of the way Brown mistreated the archetype of albinism and because I feel that since he took so much care to research art history, the history of secret societies and of religion and symbolism, he really ought to have researched albinism as well.  I hope that when they make the film adaptation of this book that they will rewrite Silas' character entirely, and rely on some other back-story device, rather than albinism, to explain his violent madness.acter entirely, and rely on some other back-story device, rather than albinism, to explain his violent madness.",

Unlike some other &quot;page turners&quot; this one does require the reader to pay close attention to figure out the case.  Some of the aspects of the book were a bit of a let down as they were rather predictable, but probably seemed more so because of the unexpected twists and turns the Brown offers.  A good book if you are on the road and want something to read at the airport.",

As a theology student, not everything mentioned by Brown is completely impossible, especially if one considers that what we have as the Bible and Christian tradition comes out of the social biases of the last 3,000 years and that they are incredibly patriarchal. One bite I have is that his characters conclude that if Jesus were married then he could not have been divine (away with the incarnation, resurrection, etc.). Maybe it's not that black and white. ...Have fun reading it and then DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.",

        "body": "Exasperating... this is the only word I can find to describe this insult to the writing art. It could be forgiven only if it was the work of a budding 14 years old aspiring writer.. The characters are stereotypical mannequins monstruosly bumping aroud in a shallow, totally unrealistic plot devoid of any originality. The Harvard professor is shy and reserved, the english lord is snob and the french cryptologist.. well she is hot! Inconsistencies and blunders are scattered all over the place, and leave you in this strange state when you don't know if you want to throw the book away in a fit of rage or have a great laugh at such an helpless author. The Harvad professor and the cryptologist together have the brain of a turnip, fighting hard to solve little riddles that would be a joke for kid. But what made really burts with laughter was the choice of the super secret passord that should have securely guarded the cryptex (basically a bycicle lock) containing the precious Holy Grail secret.. the Gran Master chose his grandaughter's name! Anyone who has even a slight familirity with security knows that a loved person name is the first and most obvious and stupid password choice of a dummy! :)Another comical side is the attitude of Langdon and Sophie towards feelings and sex... when you read that Sophie has interrupted all contact with her beloved grandfather you imagine all sort of violent things..murder.. pedophily, ..rape and it finally turns out she just caught him giving a 'ride' to a middle aged plump lady? Coooooome on!!!! And ok, you had to have a couple to make the story just a bit more stereotypical.. but at least make something reaistic, comlex and deep happen! No, by the end of the story Langdon and Sophie share only a timid kiss 'full of promise'. Is the author a teenager or just trying to win the favours of the neo-con prude wave?And the final blow.. at the end of all that road, the little secrets and passords and riddles.. there is nothing like the Grail but just a happy family reunion! In the best tradition of old telenovelas....Citing a really trashy italian TV show I could yell 'Carramba che Sorpresa!'.the Grail but just a happy family reunion!

        "body": "Seth Franzman's statement:In the end this book is a great fascinating tale of suspense, but it is a fictional book. Lots of people including ABC news have been duped into beleiving this book has 'truth' to it when it is based on NO EVIDENCE whatsoever. The bible and Josephus are the only documents that speak of the life of Jesus. In neither work is Mary magdelane spoken of as a wife of Jesus. In no place is mary magdelane not a prostitute. The bible is clear on this. If you dont beleive the biblet hats fine, but you cant just make up history whern no text or evidence exists.Response:1) There are many more documents that speak of the life of Jesus.  Since you mention Josephus, I assume you're also including documents outside what is considered Christian canon.2) Mary Magdalene is *never* spoken of as a prostitute.  She had seven demons driven from her.  It was another Mary who was a prosititute.  It's church tradition that casts Magdalene in the role of a prostitute (the theory is that one of the Popes wanted to consolidate the Marys).  I challenge you to find one instance in which Mary Magdalene is called a prostitute.My point is, before all these one star reviewers go around challenging the &quot;facts&quot; in this fictional book (should be a moot point, right?), perhaps they should check the facts themselves.",

        "body": "This was my first time to read a work of Dan Brown's and I have to admit that I am impressed.I picked up The DaVinci Code on the premise that it was a sort of historical mystery novel in the vein of Wilbur Smith's 'The Seventh Scroll' which I thoroughly enjoyed.While a good number of people would question the accuracy of Brown's information with regard to the Grail, Opus Dei, the Priory of Sion, Mary Magdalene and other religious content, I merely took this as a work of fiction loosely grounded on some facts.Doing that, I have to say that Dan Brown makes the book almost impossible to put down. The character of Robert Langdon is compelling and has a lot of potential to carry off a series of books with him in the lead.The way Brown dangles clues and mysteries without giving them away immediately contributes to the building of a suspenseful atmosphere. It makes one anxious to flip pages to get to the answers. In my opinion, that makes a great book.I heartily recommend this book for those interested in historical fiction. But devout Catholics (like me) beware, one really has to approach this book with a lot of open-mindedness and understanding.",

With those things in mind- I enjoyed the book very much!The basic plot was about Sophie and Robert, two people that fate threw together who were now on the run from the police and on a search for the Holy Grail.  Secrets abound!!  People are not who they seem!  Interesting theory after theory is discussed as these two race across Europe to avoid being not only losing the secret of the Grail and find out it's true meaning- but to avoid being murdered.The book was quite fast paced, with short chapters- which I liked.  I also began to like the characters in the book and began to wonder how it would end- would they find out the secret of the Grail?  With many twists and turns up until the very end, this book kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was worth the read, and it certainly made me think about my religion in a different light.  Again- if you go into reading this book with the mind-set that this is fiction, I think you'll enjoy it as you would any fiction mystery or suspense novel.",

But when I got about half-way thru it, I decided it was time for me to stop. Dan Brown is a brilliant man, but he needs to check his sources if he wants to slag the Catholic church like that. I've been a Caholic since I was a week old and it's a huge part of who I am. Most of the historical information presented in the book is false, but he seems to clearly state otherwise in the introduction. Opus Dei is real, but nothing like what happened in the book would ever happen in real life. I just find it deeply offensive that Dan Brown writes about another instance where the Catholic church is being humiliated, even though it is ficticious, in the midst of the sex-abuse scandal wew are facing right now. So overall, enjoy the story, but ignore the historical info.",
