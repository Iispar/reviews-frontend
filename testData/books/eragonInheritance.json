The pace is excellent (not a lot of down time), the detail is plenty but not overpowering, and the story line is fun and engaging (even if it is a bit stereotypical).  I can't wait for the second book in the series to arrive.",

        "body": "My friend let me borrow the book 'Eragon' not too long ago, and I finally started reading it. I must say, if you like fantasy, you will definately like this book. And the first thing you will notice is that it has every aspect you can think of, or at least recognize, from other fantasy and sci-fi novels - common ones in fact. This leaves the story dry at times, as Paolini tries to rush into things, especially at the beginning. It seems when you read the first few chapters, you've already read half the book. But his writing is wonderful for someone so young to be published, I must give him credit on that.But things that caught my eye is the way he practically excerpts other fantasy books, most of which you may have read already. Reading about trolls, dwarves, and elves and the 'Ancient Language' was practically cut from Lord of the Rings, and even by just watching the movie, everything that relates is clearly evident. Also, I am a huge Anne McCaffrey fan of her Dragonriders novels, and I felt a bit strange to see it 'ripped off' so to speak...He speaks of 'Dragon Riders', as of course the main character (Eragon), goes through the similar process of obtaining a dragon as 'Dragonriders of Pern' novels write, and McCaffrey's books are practically a legacy. Simply, Eragon finds a 'rock' (it's really a dragon egg) that hatches into a dragon and connects 'mentally' with his mind, ect. Brom even explains the dragon chooses the person, and all of that seems directly taken from the Pern novels. A bit different, all in the end.As good as a writer he is at his age, there are still things that he needs to work on. I'm not a genuis writer myself, but you will find yourself baffling at times when a random comment/explanation comes up in the middle of an unrelated conversation, which leads to more and more unrelated ideas. It seems Paolini put more 'information' into his characters rather than personality, which leaves it bluntly, DRY. You will quickly get over his 'saids' and 'dids' at first, and become used to the over-under descriptiveness, or the more/less detail needed for a certain situation. But the book is great, and will keep you reading for a while (as thick as it is).Final conclusion - not for hardcore fantasy readers. I'm not even a hardcore fantasy reader, and I still feel like I'm reading 10 books at once, all ideas taken from other books (Tolkien, McCaffrey, ect). It's not necessarily a 'fresh' new fantasy world with beliefs, ect, but certainly enjoyable to most.ds' and 'dids' at first, and become used to the over-under descriptiveness, or the more/less detail needed for a certain situation.

This book made me laugh, sit at the edge of my seat, feel sad, and everything else in between. Eragon combines all of these together into one beautiful book. When I finished this book, I just looked outside and had to take a few minutes to let it all soak in because of the power this book had. This is well-written and is a must have for anyone who likes Fantasy Books. I have given my copy of this book to my sister, reccomended it to my friends, and telling everyone I know to buy this book!

        "body": "I bought this book based on the dust cover description. However, once I got into the book, I discovered it was a rip of many other books of the fantasy genre -- a sort of melding of a lot of other books. For example, comparing it to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, in Eregon Shades are the equivalent of Fades (even the names are similar), the Forsworn are once powerful men who become corrupted in Eragon, just the same as the Forsaken in the Wheel of Time. And the similarities with other books don't end there.The character development is weak. Eragon changes from a mild mannered boy into a moody independent teenager overnight and seemingly aquires skills without effort. His dragon hatches and is sarcastic in a couple short months. Brom plays hide the ball about his past and skills to a point where nobody in their right mind would trust him. In the end, the characters are so unbelievable as to be the main failing in the book.Finally, the story is very predictable with little suspense. It ambles along in a we did this, then did that narrative fashion. If you are a fantasy reader familiar with many of the other big authors, this book will be a let down, despite its intriguing basic story line.Despite all that, the writing is fine for a technical viewpoint. Places and things are well described and no more verbose than necessary to paint a picture. Thus, this book merits more than one star, but no more than two.",

        "title": "Mythic, but perhaps too much so.",
        "body": "Everyone here seems to be extremely divided in their views of this book, and I'm afraid I fall in the dislike camp.Okay, let's start with the plot. I must admit it is quite enjoyable, if you are in such unlikely circumstances that you are both inclined to like fantasy, and have not read most of the modern classics in said genre; or, perhaps, you have to have read enough awfully-written stories to know cliches when you see them. Basically, Eragon embarks upon a quest for revenge against shadow forces he doesn't know much about, but which will undoubtedly have something to do with his 'mysterious past.'While most people mention fantasy books as inspiration, I find Eragon's plot more reminiscent of Star Wars than of anything else. There's the dead order of peace-keepers with amazing powers, the main character's mysterious past (Who's his father? He doesn't know!), the magical power, the old man with long-dead secrets of the past, which of course he teaches to this headstrong youth without really bothering about whether he's _good_ or not, and most tellingly, the destruction of the boy's farm and death of his uncle, which in both Star Wars and Eragon sets the main character off on a quest of revenge. Just thank heaven there's no C3P0...In terms of concepts, there are very few original ideas, either. Paolini draws from Tolkien's works, not just Lord of the Rings but background materials as well, and, I am told, Anne McCaffrey's (sorry if I misspelled that) Pern books. Personally, I can't stand McCaffrey's writing, which is why I can't speak for myself on that one. Anyway, all of the races are almost exactly the same, down to the origins of the elves across the sea (Tolkien came up with that one, folks!); while Urgals and the Ra'zac are original, as far as I know, they are shadily described. Indeed, the Urgals always remind me of the Knights who say Ni, a la Monty Python, which rather kills their potential as villans.Paolini attempts to make his world original and fresh by adding in what he seems to think is his own idea, judging by the care he takes in explaining it: an ancient language, a true language, with magical power. Unfortunately, his implementation of this idea has two flaws: 1) lacking a proper knowledge of the mechanics of language, he has created a set of _words_ with absolutely no grammar involved, so that to get across a complex idea you have to smoosh words together and hope that it works; and 2) the words seem to have been created by randomly pounding on the keyboard, and adding vowels where he thought them necessary. They're not unpronouncible, as this has created a tongue with a phonology similar to Russian, or perhaps closer to Czech; but I doubt that was intentional, as my high school is one in, I think, a little over fifty in the United States that actually teaches Russian. 'Brisingr' is a word that simply could not exist in any Romance or Germanic language, and, as I said, I doubt that Chris Paolini put much thought into making his language original (even Tolkien, a philologist, only used harsh Slavic sounds in his black speech, the tongue of evil) when all the rest of his work has little or no thought in that area. Originality, I mean.One more thing. Eragon is grammatically correct throughout, a fact for which I am thankful, but shows distinct signs of having been written by a ten-year-old - and yes, I know the author was fifteen at the time of publishing. So what? I'm sixteen, and I can still vary my sentence structure. Learning to do so was an integral part of my 7th grade English education! All of Eragon's sentences are short, less than a line long, and generally begin with either an article (a or the) or the subject of said sentence; occasionally you'll find another adjective there instead, if you're lucky. I have not noticed a single subordinate clause in the entire book, and have been appalled at the blatant lack of semicolons. Semicolons! Whatis the world coming to, if people can say a story without semicolons is worth reading?Still, Eragon did wonders as light, mindless reading material - besides, of course, the choppy writing style inherent in a book with uniform sentence structure and a dearth of semicolons - and so, rather than a one, I give it two stars out of five.P.S. - I haven't seen anyone else comment on this particular name theft, so I thought I'd mention it. You know the Bid'duam? Turn it around and what do you get: Muad'dib. Frank Herbert alone could sue the kid for plaigarism; I'd hate to see what the Tolkien estate would do if they got word.say a story without semicolons is worth reading?

There are many ways to depict a struggle between men, dragons, elves and dwarves without 'ripping off' Tolkien. And Christopher Paolini's mythology of the Dragon Riders is absorbing, as is the the wonderful relationship between Eragon and his dragon Saphira. I found myself racing to the end of the book, and I can't wait for the release of Book 2. So read it for its own sake, not because people say it's a take on Tolkien.

I got it out of the library and spent a few days trying to be interested in it.  It was very easy to put down.  The only reason I finished it is that I continued to read it hoping it would get better.  It did not.  This was written by a teenager, and it shows.  One hopes that his next book(s) will demonstrate his growth as a writer.  I must say I have sympathy for anyone who tries to write a fantasy novel which includes elves, dwarves and magic, because the book will inevitably be compared to Tolkien, especially now that the LOTR movies are out.However, in no way is this book 'comparable to Tolkien,' or even any of the other writers to whom Mr. Paolini has been compared, at least in terms of writing style and excellence.  The plot and 'devices' are not original; the story line is VERY like Star Wars, and the dragon/magic and relationships are similar to those in novels by Anne McCaffrey, Raymond Feist and Terry Brooks (no offense to these writers).  The writing is disjointed, uneven and dull.  There is much extraneous information which the reader tucks away in his memory, thinking it will be used later, but it is never mentioned again.  Nearly every chapter ends with Eragon falling asleep or becoming unconscious.  I had to laugh at some of the lines, such as 'White mist rose up off the river, like blood steaming in winter.'  Surely that is something every reader can relate to (?)One can hope as Mr. Paolini matures that his writing will also.

        "body": "When I heard about this book and how young its author was, I was intrigued, and began reading it to see if it was as good as it was supposed to be.  I was dubious at first, and spent the first couple chapters analyzing everything looking for evidence of the youth of its author.  No doubt there is plenty, and the style is not extremely refined, but it's difficult to keep concentrating on that, because the overall quality is so high and the story so good. Soon I gave up and let myself get swept away into the land of Alagaesia, for indeed, in true Tolkienesque fashion, Paolini creates a genuine secondary world. It has a fairly elaborate geography, an ancient language (not nearly as sophisticated or realistic as Tolkien's, of course, and at times clearly contrived, but overall fairly convincing), a long history many times hinted at and partly explained, and a complex array of races and political entities. Paolini does a good job of borrowing elements from Tolkien and other fantasies, yet maintaining originality--indeed, a good fantasy author should not be creating something totally original at all, for as Tolkien explains in his famous essay, 'On Fairy-Stories,' it is his job to draw pieces out from the great 'Cauldron of Story' and rearrange them into a new, yet familiar tale that then becomes part of the Cauldron. Indeed, Paolini shows himself to be well-educated in much of the literary and mythological background for fairy-stories, or fantasy, particularly in his appropriation of names (Hrothgar, for example, is the name of the dwarf-king).  Paolini does an excellent job of never revealing too much at once, but always keeping much of Eragon's surroundings shrouded in mystery--even something as basic as who the good guys are and who the bad guys are is very slow to be unveiled.A couple things that do need improvement (and which I hope to see improve in Books 2 and 3 of the trilogy as his writing style matures): many of the stylistic devices are rather cliched, and the writing never ascends to a level that quite does justice to the emotion and epic scale of the events in the book.  In Tolkien, for example, many sentences are so beautiful that they are worth quoting and remembering in and of themselves, irrelevant of context.  Such sublimity is rare, however, in Eragon.  Also, the POV often is a bit too introspective for a tale of epic scale--Paolini would do better not to relate, verbatim, every thought that passes through Eragon's head.Nevertheless, Paolini succeeds in creating a convincing and alluring alternate world, and of making the reader forget for a time that it is only a fantasy world, and genuinely care about what happens in it; and that is the purpose of fantasy.I highly recommend it.liched, and the writing never ascends to a level that quite does justice to the emotion and epic scale of the events in the book.

The sentences are awkward, and one moment Eragon will be speaking 'grandly' (albeit ridiculously) and the next he'll sound like some kid from the 21st century. The characters are all paper-thin - truly cardboard cutouts. I could not find one interesting character, except for Angela, who at least had a little redeeming originality and depth. And most of all - what's up with Eragon? He's the whiniest, dullest, most annoying protagonist I've ever had to struggle through 500+ pages with.Half the time I truly wanted to set Saphira's dainty little blue tail on fire. Paolini apparently attempted to make her the 'ultimate' best friend - and failed miserably. Witty, intelligent, caring, warm, sympathetic?

        "title": "Fun but lacks originality - plot is from 1st Star Wars movie",
        "body": "This is a decent book for the target audience of older children and preteens, who have finished the Harry Potter books and The Hobbit but might find Lord of the Rings too difficult. Its strong points are a good pacing and excitment level. But the big downside of it is the lack of originality. Alagaesia is very much a simpler version of Tolkien's Middle Earth, especially the Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs/Urgals. The noble Dragonriders who are telepathically bonded to their dragons are straight out of Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern; she must have been flattered by this imitation to have given the testimony on the back cover. But most important and most annoying is that the plot and characters are lifted straight from the first STAR WARS movie. Luke Skywalker was a young man of uncertain parentage whose uncle was killed by soldiers of the Empire, who turned to a wise Jedi Master and began his training in the ways of the Force and joined the Rebellion, until the old Jedi Master was killed and passed his powers on to Luke. Along the way Luke teamed up with a scoundrel who helped him rescue a beautiful princess from the clutches of the Empire. The movie ends with the Rebellion acheiving a great although not final victory over the evil empire, and Luke leaves to go to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with Master Yoda. In this book, the sf world is changed to a Tolkien-fantasy world, Luke is renamed Eragon, Obi-Wan is renamed Brom, and Han Solo is Murtagh. If the second and third books of this trilogy continue to follow the Star Wars trilogy, the second book will start with Galbatorix's forces attacking a secret base of the Varden again, but Eragon will travel to the Mourning Sage in Ellesmera to complete his training; however he will get a warning that Murtagh and Arya are in danger and leave his training before he has full control of his powers. Book two should end with Eragon confronting Galbatorix and learning to his horror that he is Galbatorix's son, while Murtagh is captured by the Empire. But Eragon will rescue him early in Book three, then go back to the Mourning Sage who will die, and Book Three should end with Eragon defeating Galbatorix and the Varden defeating the Empire, and Eragon founding a new order of Dragonriders to bring peace and justice to the Galaxy (err, Alagaesia). Anyway, you get the point. But it's still a fun book, and younger readers won't mind the lack of originality as much as adults will.agh is captured by the Empire.

        "body": "Eragon seemed like a book I really wanted to buy when I had first heard of it. Usually I'm very intuitive about books and I've bought many books without even reading them, trusting that I would certainly love them. Nine times out of ten, that is the case. But Eragon turned out the be the one out of ten that I wish I hadn't bought. Initially, it seems worth the time to read it. But I was nearly half way through the book when it occured to me that I had no particular feelings towards any of the characters. The story lacks emotion and the level of familiarity in the course of events that is necessary for a reader to truly connect with the characters and relate to them. I found that I was growing bored with the story, which seemed to be a strange combination of DragonHeart, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and a little bit of Harry Potter thrown in. It has been suggested that 'Eragon' will rival The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. All in all, 'Eragon' just tries too hard to keep up with those classics, and doesn't come close to delivering the unique quality of its predecessors. I would not recommend buying this book unless you read it first and really like it, or just like to collect fantasy novels.",

The first is a large blue saphire stone found by a young hunter who is sparring after game in a forboding area known as The Spine.  The stone...is not a stone...Eragon discovers that it is an egg.  An egg that hatches a saphire blue winged dragon who is later named Saphira.Upon their meeting the dragon immediately bonds with Eragon making their thoughts heard by each other. This creates an incredibly deep emotional seal between these main two roles.  They feel each other's pain and joy. Together they must vanquish an empire ruled by the only other living dragon rider named King Galbatorix and a fiend of terrible power, a Shade.Eragon plots a direction to revenge his uncle and is joined by a man of mystery named Brom who will mean a great deal to him for he unveils much about Eragon and his startling abilities.  His travels take him far and he faces many conflicts and his eventual entry into a secret city inhabited by Dwarves and humans who call themselves the Varden.  Their society is tied together wtih an incredible breathtaking treasure.Which reminds me,  I told you there were two saphires....The second is a boulder, a massive red star saphire wrought into a mystic rose marking the entrance into the ancient dragonhold.  When saphire collides with saphire.... a true epic is born.The first five chapters did little to impress me though...especially when the term 'sorcerer's stone' cropped up ... it wasn't until the Mythos of the dragon riders were revealed that I became enthralled in this book filled with questions and secrets.  This book comes across as fantasy mystery to me and I thoroughly enjoyed the readThere is much for everyone, mystery, epic stories, even a little humor.  If you like fantasy and are a fan of beautiful dragons....then please indulge yourself in ERAGON. ",

His characters are well-developed, his imagery strong, and his wit keen but subtle enough to avoid seeming forced.At times, he gets bogged down in descriptive detail, but the book and its engaging storyline easily overcome such minor flaws, and it ends up developing into a true page-turner.And unlike much of today's mass-produced fantasy fiction, Eragon has literary merits. It it well-written, has satisfying depth and offers tantalizing hints about what is to come in the next two books. (Who is Eragon's mother? What's the deal between Eragon and Arya? Is Murtagh a good guy or not?) Fantasy lovers will also enjoy the appendices, which include a glossary, a pronunciation guide, a series of language guides, and a map that readers will find themselves referring to constantly.Paolini is a young author with promise, and 'Eragon' is a must-read book that is bound to lure new fans to the genre while satisfying old ones.",

        "title": "an example of how _not_ to write",
        "body": "I would not have completed _Eragon_ if I had not wanted to write a review. (I don't think it's fair to write a review of a book one has not finished.) The finishing, though, required considerable force of will. I did not enjoy this book.Eragon has many faults, but I'll stick with four: first, Mr. Paolini cannot decide what kind of book he wants to write - a children's book or an adult fantasy, a story in mythic language (Tolkien style) or in the more modern fantasy traditions. His indecision produces absurd combinations of language and event. For instance, the plot of Eragon is so transparent and predictable as to be surprising only to a small child. One tends to assume, therefore, that it is a children's book. Yet the author casually tosses in a bit of dialogue in which a female elf describes how, after torture, she was given to the garrison for rape. She solved her problem by magically making her rapists impotent. The language is terse, but the meaning unmistakable. This seems a bit adult for a children's book. In addition, the narration see-saws inconsistently between mythic language and modern speech. Paolini's attempts to describe events such as the one above in grand mythic language make the writing feel almost farcical. There's another bit where he tries to grandly describe how the villain kicked the good guy 'in the fork of the legs' and un-chivalrously won a fight. If Paolini was sticking to gritty, modern fantasy-style narration, or if he was intending to write a parody, this sort of thing might work. However, in his high Tolkien-esque monologues, it sounds absurd. Sadly, this sort of unintentional farce is the _only_ humor in the book.Problem number two: Mr. Paolini would benefit greatly from Steven's King's short, but brilliant, manual _On Writing_. I'm thinking particularly of the sentence, 'Adverbs are not your friends.' I grew exceedingly weary of needless adverbs tacked onto the end of every over conversation tag, (said the reviewer irritably.)Problem number three: the protagonist is stupid. He is so stupid, I hated him by the end of the first chapter, and he doesn't get any brighter. The dragon is actually walking around his room before he realizes that *bing!* the 'rock' was an egg! Of course, if Eragon was _supposed_ to be a half-wit or a young child, this might work. Readers don't mind figuring out events in advance of an admittedly young or stupid protagonist. However, this is not the case. In fact, everyone is continually telling Eragon how he is exceptionally bright, and he is forever discovering new and wonderful abilities that he performs better than anyone else.Finally, 'show, don't tell' is most emphatically not a phrase in this author's vocabulary. I grew bored to tears of his endless explanations - pages and pages of dialogue in which various characters laboriously map out for Eragon the hows and wherefores of his world.One might ask: if I found the book so distasteful, why give it two stars instead of one? The reason is that I do think the author has some talent, though perhaps not best displayed in a novel. In fact, this book read very like the script for a King's Quest-style role playing game. In that media, I think the story might actually be quite charming, and many of the more annoying elements would not survive the transition. But for a novel...? No.It is, of course, possible that the writer will clean up his style in a blindingly superior manner before he writes the next book (nothing is resolved in this one), but I wouldn't count on it. Nothing short of large amounts of money could induce me to read the sequel.y.)    Problem number three: the protagonist is stupid.

        "body": "I truly wanted to enjoy this book.  But as mentioned before, the hype that went with it made have actually hurt it, since fantasy readers and 'experienced' readers will expect so much more from such a 'young prodigy'.  truth is that the book is not bad, it is a nice and quick read for fantasy fans, but it will be that for younger readers and readers that are just getting into the fantasy books.  If you have read Tolkien and Pullman and so many others you will be dissapointed by the book, cause it ends up being a D&D story, and any HS in the world has a good teen writer that can come up with a book like this.  The plot clearly is the product of an inexperienced writer who read Tolkien (old wise man, Elven princess with a thing for the human, a hidden city in the mountains)and saw Star Wars (rebel 'princess' with a thing for the rouge hero, hero finds missing sibbling - this last bit was not part of book 1 but you can see it comming a mile away)and formulated a very simply and predictable story (there was not one single plot twist that surprises or that doesn't have a direct relation with SW and LOTR, except for the telepathic dragon and I've been told that is also an idea from other fantasy series).the kid has potential, but the marketing has over hyped the quality of the book, which would hurt any developing writer. It doesn't help that the author over-hyped himself as well; on his site he claims to strive 'for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf'.  Now that is a mouthful not easily lived up to.  And from his use of language and prose, his editor should let him know he is years and years away from that.Since he is maturing, hopefully the 2nd book will reflect that, but from the reviews so far, this may not be the case.  For younger readers, non-English speakers this is a good choice, since the language is simple, the story easy to follow.",

The kid plods from one episode to another.  There is nothing going on in parallel.  Nothing unexpected or hidden secrets encountered.  The book gets a bit slow.  The final duel with the sorcerer was anticlimatic.  I liked the link to the elfin magic user while the kid was in his delerium, so am going to give the second book a shot.",

        "body": "From what I have seen for both myself, and in reading prior reviews, the utterly blatant lifting of plot elements is fairly rampant. But what 15 year old author doesn't want to replicate his favorite authors? The problems with this book are primarily in the worldbuilding aspect of the book. Yes, one sees Middle Earth; yes, one sees Star Wars; hell, I even found Norwegian myth, Beowulf, and George R. R. Martin.The type of reader that doesn't enjoy an archetypal hero story won't enjoy this book. It is a simple, linear plot, but in this context it is effective, as it is written and marketed as a children's book. And contrary to some opinions written here, there are definitely strong female characters with at least one who is given substance in this book and two more who I am certainly itching to hear more about.I read through this book quickly, the chapters are short which keeps the pace quick and exciting. It will make great bedtime reading for kids since there are plenty of stopping points. I predict that with the writing experience that Paolini is gaining, and the critiques he is sure to have read, the next book in the series will far outdo this one.",

        "body": "From the moment I started reading this book I literally COULD NOT set it down. I am a freshman in college who also works full time so I don't have much spare time. Yet I found enough time to finish this book in a little under 48 hours. Two nights in a row I was up far past 3am reading, only to get up and read in my classes. Yes, this book is THAT GOOD!When looking back, this story does not have any details that stand out among any other fantasy books. It actually seems to incorporate many of the stories I have read into one story. While I am sure this was unintentional, it does leave me thinking, 'Have I read that somewhere before?'The story is about a boy named Eragon, who becomes the first Rider in centuries. A Rider is a man who has bound himself mentally with a dragon. All of the Riders have been killed off by the current King, who himself is a Rider, albeit an evil one. Riders live unusually long lives, so it seems that this evil king's reign will never end.Eragon's adventure takes him from his small shire-like home to large cities and into the depths of mountains. He runs into people who will lie, cheat, steal, and deceive to get what they want. All the while he meets people who would give their life for what they believe in. Along his way he meets elves, dwarfs, and humans who have not seen the outside world for centuries.Christopher Paolini's first novel is absolutely FANTASTIC! While, as I said, parts of it do remind me of other books; it is well worth a read. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to both new and experienced fantasy readers. Trust me; you will be unable to set this one down!",

        "body": "This is a book which is getting a ton of publicity because it was written by a 15 year old. I wish that I had known that before I bought it, because I would have read it very differently and perhaps not bought it at all.Eragon is a heck of an achievement for any young person-- let's start with that remark. Literary judgement aside, Paolini created a 497 page novel that hangs together reasonably well at an age when many kids have trouble turning out a ten page book report. So, well done! There are many really nice moments in the book, and it kept me reading despite the flaws. He shows a real flare for writing about politics and he has very smooth and mature diction when he writes.However, as a fantasy read it leaves a great deal to be desired. It is clearly very derivative-- the sources from which it draws are barely disguised at all. The hero is unreasonably good at everything he does, and the dragon is very conveniently wise. Perhaps if you have not read the books from which this is drawn it will not grate quite as much, but in a writer of any other age the direct lending of moments from other writers would not have been tolerated.I am not sure that Random House has done Paolini a service by publishing this book. He is clearly potentially a very talented writer, and I look forward to reading his adult work when he is more able to incorporate his influences into his own vision. A book should be able to stand on its own without the corresponding footnote excusing the quality based on the age of the author. I hope that he is realizes that different standards will be required, once he no longer qualifies as a prodigy.",

There is no such thing in real life as 'good magic' it is not posible. Nither can magic be used for good in real life. Don't get me wrong I am not talking about 'magic tricks' for they are not 'real.' I am saying true wichcraft and sorcery thease can NOT be used for good. Do not read this book. I am writing this becuse not many other revews would go this far to tell of what the backround theams are. Those who do not like Harry Potter do not read this book. In my opinion this book is much more about evil than good. Yes, I know it's 'fantasy' but the themes of magic are much more intence than other fantasys I have read. If you don't listen to me on that listen to me when I say that this book is, with the exeption of magic taught, is not much diffrent than other fantasys. Also its not even my writen well, in opinion. Please ignore my other revew, This is not a book worth reading. Read, 'Black' by Ted Dekker insted. Do not read this book, but if you do, not that I am saying to at all becuse DON'T, remember that the theames of are incorrect. This book is not an allegory and I am not saying that all the use of magic in allegorys is incorect for they sometimes are repersinting an actual event, to tell it in a difrent way. Though I am not saying that the use of magic in all allegorys are not incorect. Some are cetantly not used in the right way. This is my opinion at this time and may cahnge.

He weighed the odds, then said icily, 'Spread out; hide behind trees and bushes. Stop whoever is coming . . . or die.'The story telling doesn't involve characterization, so much as the descriptive details you might expect to find on a Dungeons and Dragons character sheet.  It seems that in some sectors 'young adult' writing is simply synonymous with bad writing, but I must stress that this simply isn't so.  Examples from my childhood - such as Madeleine L'Engle or Ursula K. Le Guin, or even contemporary writers - The Spiderwick Chronicles (with DiTerlizzi's excellent illustrations) and Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events come to mind as contemporary examples of creative fantastical story telling.The plot is hackneyed and clich&eacute;d.  Readers are unlikely to come out of the experience with a single thing that couldn't be taken from the typical fantasy series of the past fifty years, be it McAffrey's works or the Dragonlance Chronicles.Don't let the publicity fool you.  This book is certifiably awful.  Like Subway's Jared, it's an example that our society is leaning towards the celebration of individuals who try harder at selling themselves than at accomplishing something worthwhile.  I've worked with young writers for a while as something of an instructor and mentor, aiding them in improving their work and reaching their target audience, and the vast majority of them have produced writing far better than this.  I find it incomprehensible that people can welcome something that isn't even up to par with other works by those of the same age.  This lacking falls well short of even Jordan and Goodkind, who I consider terrible enough.Don't waste your time. ...l short of even Jordan and Goodkind, who I consider terrible enough.

I felt like I'd read this book about 30 times before.Quick note for you folsk who are coming to Paolini's defense about blatantly ripping off Tolkien. Tolkien took loose 'ideas' from Norse/Scandinavian myth, such as Elves, Dwarves, etc. He then imbued them with HIS OWN ORIGINAL racial characteristics, abilities, languages(yes--often based on other languages), etc. Thwey became something they never had been before--a sum that was greater than the parts it consisted of. These 'fantasy races' have been copied all over the place, from the original Dungeons & Dragons game (does anyone actually play that anymore or did Magic kill it?) to a slew of imitator novelists. What makes Chris Paolini's book so patehtic is that he didn't even TRY to modify his races, and in some cases came up with ridiculous new names to try to mask his lack of creativity (such as his weak attempts at 'hiding' orcs, Uruk-Hai, Nazgul, etc.) His races are a pale and transparent imitation of those found in Tolkien.Great authors like Tolkien take other ideas, mold and shape them, and make them their own. Pathetic authors like Paolini try to simply work with the clay droppings the masters have left on the floor. Following this analogy to its logical conclusion, Mr. Paolini insn't a very good author and he sure as heck is a terrible potter. Save your money folks--this book stinks.",

I might add to those comments that JK Rowling is a good example of an author who, although extremely derivative of all fantasy novels which came before her, weaved these old ideas in a new and fresh and fun way.  The characters in Eragon are stock and do not exhibit realistic development. Rather they simply fit right into new and fantastic roles given to them with the greatest of ease (ie: Eragon changing from farm boy to magic-wielding dragon rider in what seems like no time at all). I believe that Mr. Paolino could one day be a very good writer, but he needs to look at the mistakes made, both creatively and dramatically, in this first endeavour.",

Most of Eragorn's 'story' revolves around the past, of which people seem to like telling to him while he sat and asked questions, while his actual 'adventure' involves him going from one place to another and sometimes getting into things which he ultimately gets himself out of by being the best magician/swordfighter/something, nothing more. Brom seemed to have spoilt Eragon a bit too much. To make matters worse, all this 'telling' makes the story seem bland and mediocre at its best. Murtagh's past, for instance, was told to Eragorn in another one of these storytelling events. Where's the suspense?Then there's Saphira. Anyone else have problems with her being this perfect, pristine creature that just popped out of nowhere? She's a BABY, for Chrissakes, and yet she talks like she's been around for hundreds of years. Paolini spoilt the best part of his novel by rushing through Saphira's growth and making her an adult when she should be younger than Eragon and learning more about the world than he does. I don't buy that, 'Dragons are wise and that's the end of it,' crap. I could have cared for Saphira that way, I really would have. Rather, she becomes like this talking, perfect Lassie.The writer was fifteen when he STARTED this. Started, I would like to point out. He could have very well polished this up in the past few years before he published it. Plots can be rehashed over and over and we wouldn't tire of them (admit it, we won't) IF the writer knows how to handle his works well. Unfortunately, Eragon tried to fly, but only fell flat against the cliff. It's still an okay read, but I've read fan fiction better than this. This isn't worth publishing. Good for a first-time novel, but first-time novels should be a writer's stepping stone, not his ticket to fame...ely, Eragon tried to fly, but only fell flat against the cliff.

The book is long on details and the pace of the story drags to the point of putting the reader to sleep. The fights, either with swords or magic spells are quick and end within 1 to 2 pages and then its back to long pointless details and prodding story telling. Like, who cares how it takes to make a dragon saddle or how it takes to walk 10 miles? The 'hero' of the story Eragon doesnt seem to learn from his mistakes and continues to make the same type of mistakes over and over again every time he uses magic when fighting! Plus the constant repeating of the fall of the dragon riders and the rise of the evil king gets boring after reading it for the 3rd or 6th time! I eagerly await the second or third printing of book 1, as well as book 2 and hopefully the author will learn from his mistakes with book 1 and make book 2 a more interesting story. Change the settings and some of the charaters, pick up the pace of the story and you have a good sci-fi or star wars type of story here.",

The author didn't have to do very much description of his fantasy world because all the players were 'borrowed' from other authors' worlds --- especially Tolkien's. Paolini didn't have to explain the relationship between elves & humans & dwarves, since Tolkien fans already know all that. Fine; it's fan-fiction. But I was very disappointed that Paolini didn't give Tolkien a mention in his Acknowledgements section.Paolini even tried to mimic LotR by including some 'translated' elvish poetry. That was by far the most embarrassing part of this book. Prose was stilted (really needed some professional editing), but the poetry was just . . . awful. Glad it was only attempted once.Despite the book's flaws, I did enjoy the story line, and did read the book all the way through. I may even borrow a copy of 'The Eldest' when it comes out. But I would not pay money for it.",

Yes, there is more telling than showing in description. However, I was engrossed for weeks on end, my mind consumed with Paolini's fantastic world. This, I believe, would appeal more to pre-teens and younger adolescents than any other age group.  Saphira, his dragon, was the most amusing out of all of them. Despite the fact that I truly enjoyed it, I wish Paolini would show his characters carry out his actions, instead of telling them. I think that if you appreciated Lord of the Rings, and you don't mind fragments of it in Eragon, it'll captivate you.",

There were a few errors grammatically, but all in all a very enjoyable book.  It relies heavily on 'other' fantasy books that are also favorites, but it just adds to the reading enjoyment of those who were hooked on 'The Hobbit', 'Lord Of The Rings' or even the Harry Potter books.  Since I like to read the books my students read, I have to admit I enjoyed it.  It is not the five stars of the above named books (yes, I LOVED Harry Potter), but it is a good read.  I am going to order the next book and see if the interest maintains through book two.  If you like fantasy, this book is for you.",

The main character, Eragon (AKA 'Aragorn' from Lord of the Rings), sets off on a quest to overthrow the evil ruler of a land that resembles Middle Earth (as seen in the Tolkien-esque map provided at the beginning of the book) with the help of an old magician, Brom (AKA Gandalf). Sound familiar? Well, the rest of the story will, too.Given his age, Christopher Paolini is a great writer, and he has very good potential, but he's still in the beginning stages of writing where one imitates the great writers. Once he finds his own voice, he'll probably blow our socks off. But in the meantime, save your money! Or, better yet, spend it on a better investment--Lord of the Rings.",

I've worked in publishing for about 15 years, and this book would never have made it out of the slush pile at the company I worked for. Mr. Paolini is simply not a very good writer, and his style is a poor example for children. The story is indeed as derivative as all of the reviewers who actually put some thought into their reasing have stated, and hisp ortrayl of females is downright non-existant (I'm sure a product of Mr. Paolini's own lack of familiarity with this subject at the time of his writing--he was an adolescent after all).I wouldn't recommend this book to any young person I know, or to any parent. This is the muzak version of a Beatles tune, or the Sci-Fi Channel version of Frank Herbert's books. Nice try---but it doesn't cut the mustard. Perhaps Mr. Paolini should find a new career.

I guess if I had expected a great epic I would have disappointed, but I expected a rip-off. Because of the name I associate it with Aragorn from LOTR, it however is very unlike LOTR. It's fast paced, very humanistic in my view, and ultimately more doomed in a way. The hero could be anyone (though honestly it can't). It gives the book a hopeless appeal. You want the hero to overcome, but you know it would be easier for failure. It was easy to fall in love with the characters, and I loved the excess background. It reminds me more of Potter than any other series. But the interesting thing is although it's your cut and dry fantasy, there are many twists on the old standby's which I enjoyed, and would now view as standbys. Overall I give it a B Grade, it could be better in writing, but the story is so captivating I lost all since of words.",

As for the book, its what they call in Lit. a 'Mary Sue,' its like a fanfiction in which the author imposes hims self as the infallible protagonist stricken with unproventable tragedy. It is the most common type of amature writing, every true writer has done it. This will pass as it does in all practiced writers and the potential of this author will become a realty. Earagon is riddled with all those vocab word you took tests on in english and forgot and is inconsitent in tone. Despite its downfalls, while its far from original, the plot is strong and the narritive is fluid, though humanistic character development would have helped though. I dont blame paolini for his novels mediocrity as it could be expect, but rather the editor sacrificed characters and feeling for the bread and butter stereotypes that plauge the genre  all the while forgetting the basics of correcting implausiblities. I would also point out that this is a CHILDRENS novel and should be treated as such and was not written for the same people that an Edding writes. For what it is there is promise and i was not too unbearable to finish. I recomed you borrow the book or check it out of the library, its not worth it to buy it.",

We absolutely could not wait to see what would happen next. This is a great book for boys age 10-15. It's a challenging read that's full of action. This is definitly more in the vein of the Hobbit and Lord of the rings than Harry Potter. As for the complaints of predictibility and similarity to LOTR I would say that all fantasy of this nature is pretty much based on LOTR so you really can't slam the kid for doing what countless other authors (including Ms. Rowling) have done and adapting those characters to his own story.What I enjoyed about this book was the pacing. It rarely felt slow and over burdened with detail (entering the dwarf city was the one exception)which is a common problem for most fantasy writers. Paolini cuts to the heart of whatever situation his characters are in. I loved reading this book with my son and can't wait for the next one.",

Eragon staisfied my appetite for a good, decent, and understandable story about dragons, and Eragon and Saphira. I enjoyed the plot development and the creativity Paolini put into making the story and its world seem real and fascinating. I wait patiently and curiously for the second book of the trilogy, Eldest, which I hope will be as good or exceed Eragon. Loved it and recommend it to all fantasy-genre lovers. Enjoy!",

        "body": "Eragon, a young lad of fifteen, is out hunting in the land of Alagaesia when something strange drops from the sky and catches the surrounding  forest on fire. It appears to be a meteorite of some kind, and his family - not being the wealthiest in the lands by any means - might be able to sell it. So Eragon picks it up and carries it back home. But no one back home seems to want it.Then one night in Eragon's room, the little 'rock' begins making strange noises. It turns out this wasn't a rock at all. But instead was a dragon's egg! One of the last eggs in all of Alagaesia. And the dragon inside (eventually named Saphira) has chosen Eragon as its rider; an ancient and noble distinction.Evil tidings are ahead for Eragon and Saphira, as the king of Alagaesia, Galbatorix, sends his minions to capture our heroes and bring them back to his castle. And these minions are horrible creatures: venomous Ra'zacs and wicked Urgals who will do anything to capture them. Eragon is forced to flee after a deadly attack on his home which ends up killing several people. But before he leaves, Brom, an old storyteller from his hometown, comes with him (this wise old-timer turns out to be much more than a simple wordsmith, too).Great and terrible deeds await Eragon on his journey. He must grapple with his own coming of age, his growing powers as a dragonrider, and deal with love and loss on multiple levels.What makes this story engrossing is Christopher Paolini's world. He's created a magical place with believable characters and interesting names. The fact that Eragon and his dragon can only communicate via telepathy is an interesting twist on an old theme (i.e., dragon/human relationships).Where the novel falls short is in originality. If you've read Lord of the Rings or The Dragon Riders of Pern, you'll be all too familiar with the storyline and its archetypal characters. The journey is pretty standard fare, too, but this young author has shown amazing promise for a first time novelist.Many readers have lambasted the author for following (or even plagiarizing) those fantasy giants who've come before him (J.R.R. Tolkien to be blunt). But many have followed in the footsteps of these giants. Indeed, most fantasy novels that came after master Tolkien's magnum opus dragged parts of the Lord of the Rings in with them. It's not plagiarism; it's reinventing the magic that these stories gave us and putting it into a new context. Oh sure, they don't break any new ground, but they weren't meant to, and I believe that Chris Paolini has done a fine job of pulling in many facets of previously done themes and putting a new character into their midst. Congratulations for that.What also drew me to this book was that when Chris Paolini first started writing this he was fifteen years old (the same age as Eragon, the hero of the story). Also was the fact that the author self-published it first, then got picked up by a large publishing house and soon after sold the movie rights for an undisclosed sum. Not bad, Chris.

I like the new takes on old ideas but the plot is really cliche and most of the charcters can be found in any fantasy novel. It is almost like a blueprint for fantasy novels.Of course the main character has parents that no one anything about, and that the main character has a great destiny before him. how many times have we heard this story? i mean come on the beginning chapters are almost straight out of Star Wars.The book looks cool but the story is anything but.",

I consider the book slightly below my 'reading level' (so to speak), but I am a 14 year old who loves Dean R Koontz, Frank Herbert, George R. R. Martin and many other books considered to be written by 'adult' novelists(I have met 2 people in my entire life around my age that read similar books as me).After finishing Lightning (a book by Dean R Koontz that I recomend greatly), I picked up this book and litterally couldn't put it down.  I stayed up till two o'clock in the morning every day for a week reading this book.  The book grabs you (sorry to use the same phrase that has conformed to book reviews over the past few decades) by shoving you strait into the action of Algaesia (can't remember how to spell it) and immersing you into Eragon's adventure.  After the adventure begins, one cannot stop reading.  This book is full of the same wonder that made both Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and The Dark is Rising Sequence the beautiful books they are: a believable world that has surprises around every corner of the path.  The only problem I had with the book was the 'Question and Answer sections' between Eragon and a certain character of the book (don't want to give away any twists :-), but this is completely minor.I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone... the endless adventures of Eragon await!",

He obviously has writing talent, but it is still raw, and I expect (hope) we will see better writing from him in years to come.  In the meantime, Eragon is a humdrum rehash of characters and plot lines we have seen before.  And there is surprisingly little action.  The majority of the book is a travel log--they're chasing something or running from something, the horses are tired, they make camp.  Again.  And again.  And again.  Occasionally something interesting happens.  The author has a nice descriptive voice, but at times he tries too hard.  He overdescribed settings to the point that it is actually hard to visualize them.  (The reader doesn't need to know exact heights, right turns, left turns, etc.  Too confusing.)  That said, I still give it three stars because I kept reading and kept wondering what would happen and intend to read the next book in the series.

        "body": "A few years ago, when I was eleven, I had begun to write my own book. It was short and sweet, and pretty good for an eleven year old. Even though I haven't tried to publish  it(Because it's still in the editing process), I am still proud of my work. For those who are so critical of writers who seem to have work that looks a lot like each other clearly don't look closely at the true styles behind the author's work or don't realize how hard it is to develope and work on a story. To work on a story you must have the dedication, the talent, the hard working mind and room for improvement. Seeing as this is Mr. Paolini's first book, I aplaud his effort. I am only fourteen myself and I am already passionatly working towards the high up goal being held as a good and solid author. And ERAGON is a good place for Mr. Paolini to start his career and start on the road of improvement. The story is of a boy and his dragon and the adventures he goes on and the challenges he faces. He has a mysterius past and a very vague future which keeps the reader hooked. I personally like those types of stories. It may seem like a typical fantasy, but all fantasies have a general guidline anyway. He has started his way up the ladder of great writers and authors alike and I admire him. For me, Paolini is what I hope to be in a few more years, a writer that is well known in many places. When I first read the About the Author page I said 'Wow, he wasn't much older than I was I when I started writing my book. That inspired me and made me continnue my long dream of becoming a writer. And if you don't believe me, try writing a two hundred page fanstasy novel right now and see how hard it is. Fanstasy takes plenty of dedication, if not more than most books do. So, go read the book, then comment on it. Use the phrase 'assume' to catch my drift, if you haven't read it and are making preconceived obnoxious commentary. Writing isn't easy, and this is an amazing effort.Ok, more on the story, Eragon is not like the other fantasy characters who have everyone on their side, and have a 'good' and 'evil' face off. Not here. This book is the way the real world works, when you can't always tell when someone you love may betray or die on you at any moment. Or when you may be faced with mental, physical, and soul deep conflicts all at once. That's Eragon, and it's only the start, the book only starts to get harsh on Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, because of many deep scars, that aren't just his alone. Soon his next task is... (Please read the book).This book is a great book for Redwall, LOTR, HARRY POTTER and all fantasy fans all over the world. If you have a good repsect for fantasy and love those kinds of books then read this. ERAGON has received the baton of fantasy writers from the best of the best. He is now running to the finsh and to an excellent career. TWO THUMBS UP!!not like the other fantasy characters who have everyone on their side, and have a 'good' and 'evil' face off. Not here.

The enchanting world, rather good characters, very good action but best of all the way you're always  surprised by what happens next. A good read for almost all ages, Eragon is amazingly good and almost great.",

But one thing that keeps popping is the author's age.  The fact is that blaming the poor quality of the writing on his youth is a bit of a cop out.  If you can write well, you can write well no matter how old you are. Sure, you improve as you go along, but a novice writer who starts at the age of 30 can be just as bad as a novice who starts at 13.  Don't give this kid the excuse; talent shows at any age, and he has very little.",

I'm a big fantasy fan and I was getting bored with all my old books.Suffice it to say I was severely disappointed.Christopher Paolini was obviously, painfully young when he wrote this.  The story idea is intriguing (even though it was stolen from so many different books and movies it was far from original), but the characters are just too... emotional.  It reads like some geeky fat kid with thick glasses and pimples was role-playing out his angst on some online forum.The main character cries.  A lot.  That's a major turn off.  Sure, men cry, but ALL THE TIME?!  And he faints.  A lot.  It's ridiculous.All in all it's a good first try.  He should go back and re-write it once he's older and has a little more experience under his belt.  I will probably go to the library to read the second and third installments, just to see if he's grown any.  But will I buy them?  Probably not.",

Not per definition something new or cleverly wrought, but utterly boring to read! After all the reviews I read it with a critical eye, but until now I just love it! I am totally immersed in the story and the world Paoloni has created, and looking forward to the time I can pick it up again. I recognize a lot of themes and parallels with other fantasy stories of course, but still I think Paolini gives them his own twists to keep you interested. There are also enough new things and inventions, though not shockingly so, it'll keep you interested but comfortable.I think all fantasylovers will enjoy this book, and I am looking forward to the next one!",

These similarities may or may not be coincidence or intended.. does it matter?  The heart of the issue is how well the Author, in mention, conveyed his own story.  T.S. Eliot, himself, said, 'Good writers borrow.  Great writers steal.'  However, if I have to explain the merits of this quote in relation to what I am sharing with you, it would be lost on you anyway.  To those, these words are not lost on; let us continue . . . Eragon, in my opinion, was well done.  No, it didn't reach the heights of Shakespeare, but for what it is, it accomplished what I think the writer set out to do: write a fantasy novel that could capture the minds of its readers.  To me, the mark of a good book is one that can enrapture me.  When I can see the story clearly in mind, and the pages become a world in which I can escape; where the characters are well developed and identifiable to its readers.  Eragon was a wonderful book to read in this aspect.  I am excited to find such Authors like Christopher Paolini, and am truly excited to see how he develops into an even better writer as his story continues to develop in the Inheritance series and after.",

After Eragon leaves his home things got much more interesting and it seems that Christopher Paolini's writing style grew tremendously within a short period of time.Sure the ideas have been done before, but truly, is there any fantasy left that hasn't been borrowed upon from previous authors?  Give the kid a break.Christopher obviously had a passion for his story as he wrote it and the emotion came through.  He has some beautifully written passages using some uncommon and refreshing vocabulary. This story is meant to be a series so of course I had to let go the more annoying charactistics of Eragon and Murtagh, etc as I know that Christopher will allow these characters to grow and change in the next books. I look forward to their journey.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and certainly to the young adults the book was written for.",

He's read all the Harry Potter books, so it should be just about right for him.My grandson will not notice the influence of other stories on this young author, Paolini. My grandson will read this book for hours of sheer delight. Just as I read Tolkein and McCaffery in high school before I became an adult and realized how heavily THEY borrowed from the many others who came before.Forget Tolkein's Aragorn!!! Did anyone even notice that replacing the 'E' in Eragon with a 'D' changes the name/word to Dragon? Big-Ups for Paolini's sense of humor.I would be happy to see more reviews from readers within a book's intended age group. It's rather usless for adults to do a pick-apart review of a book created for young readers... All we get is griping about the lack of literary sophistication. As if my 8 year old grandson would know or care.Perhaps the neigh-sayers should read works a bit more elevated on the Literary Ladder.... might better suit their adult tastes. Leave the kids books to the kids.Again, this is a wonderful reading adventure for the pre-high school set. Everyone else's time would be better spent re-reading The Silmarillion.... even if Tolkein did rip off scores of local myths and legends from around the globe.",

        "title": "Amusing on a shallow level, but otherwise lacking",
        "body": "I think that the only thing that made this book so popular and acclaimed is the fact that author Chris Paolini wrote it at fifteen and published it at eighteen.  By itself, it is nothing special.  Being a teenage fantasy writer myself, though still unpublished, I have a lot of respect for Paolini for writing the book, but not for the book itself.I felt that the book was less than average on the great scheme of fantasy, though I have seen worse.  To sum it up, this book could very well be the bastard child of Lord of the Rings and Dragonriders of Pern.  These two major influences were way too prominent, so this book did not feel like anything I hadn't read before.  There is also a pretty visable Star Wars influence.  I am just waiting for the bad overlord dude Galbatorix (worst fantasy name ever) to be archetypal hero Eragon's father.  I would laugh so incredibly hard, but I hope that isn't the case.The major error in this book is that Paolini draws too heavily from sources other than his own inspiration, which makes the book bland and unoriginal.I did not really like the writing style either.  It feels childish, yet attempts to be more sophisticated by throwing in random vocabulary words that I know would not actually be in the author's vocabulary.  Cool it with the thesaurus, Chris.  However, there were a few passages that were quite beautifully described, but you have to look really hard for them.  Otherwise, I hope that Paolini improves his writing for the next book.  I am only going to buy it to see if he develops as a writer.The plot is nothing new.  It is a regurgitated version of the stereotypical fantasy with the aforementioned influences being heaviest.  I won't bother going into details.And the characters.  The characters bothered me a lot.  The Dragon, Saphira, is by far the best character in the book.  She strikes me as being very catlike, and I absolutely love cats.  Paolini must like cats too.  Eragon, the main character, simply pissed me off.  He did not strike me as being the least bit special, having no edge or dimensions, or particularly intelligent.  Also, he has absolutely no dark side at all, something I find necessary in a well-developed character, which makes him somewhat shallow and excessively righteous.  I am sick of righteous characters.  The female character, an elf by the name of Arya, seems almost oversompensating for feminine equity, but otherwise has not been discussed in great detail.  But for now, Arya Stark in Song of Ice and Fire is a much better character.  I hope Paolini knows that the name Arya is already taken.  Oh well.  Yet there is a striking coincidence . . . Aragorn and Arwen  . . . Eragon and Arya . . . hmmmm.  I don't feel like talking about the rest of the characters because they bother me.Overall, this book is a collage of existing fantasy with a muddled pedigree of all the other fantasy books we've read.  I found Eragon amusing as a time killer and a procrastination tool for homework, but it was lacking in the vast majority of possible categories for review.  If it had been given to me in manuscript form, I would have taken my red pen to it and ripped it apart (figuritively).  What it really needs to be a good book is about five more drafts.  I can only hope that the next one is better.d me off.  He did not strike me as being the least bit special, having no edge or dimensions, or particularly intelligent.

        "body": "My son read this book and liked it so much he got the book on CD and listened to the whole thing over again.  Its a large book and my son is usually intimidated by books that size.  Once he got into it, he was sorry when it ended!Even tho the CD audio version is expensive its as wonderful as the book.  My son was especially impressed that someone his age wrote it and is eagerly anticipating the second book!  I let him write a review of it.  This is his review:The best book I read this summer was Eragon by Christopher Paolini.  This book of fantasy is an impressive 500 pages however the story is so captivating you can't stop reading. While hunting, Eragon comes across a mysterious blue stone in the woods.  He soon realizes that the stone is in fact an egg when it hatches into a small blue dragon.  For fear of punishment, Eragon must raise his dragon in secret.  Eragon begins to bond with Saphira, but an evil force soon attacks his home and kills his uncle.  Seeking revenge, Eragon sets out with his mentor Brom to find the Ra'zac while also trying to keep his dragon hidden from King Galbatorix.  Along the way Eragon learns of himself and his place in history.This book is an excellent example of fantasy containing action, adventure, magic, and fighting.  The plot moves quickly and keeps the reader interested in the story line.  Both the characters and the setting are described in great detail allowing for vivid mental pictures.  Eragon's thoughts and feelings are always shared with the reader permitting them to understand more of the character and the problems he faces.  As a teenager myself, I was able to connect with this character and understand his struggles as he faces obstacles and must learn how to mature into a brave warrior.I highly recommend this book to any teenage boy who enjoys fantasy.  I would give it two thumbs way up for being the best book I ever read.",

        "title": "Old Characters + Old Plot = A Good Read Nonetheless",
        "body": "In this, his first published novel, Paolini does not create any new themes, story lines, or characters. Rather, he takes several popular characters from other sources and molds them to his needs.  Likewise, the story lines of bad king versus good-but-outnumbered rebels, young innocent farm boy evolving into heroic warrior, etc. are hardly unknown to the science fiction genre but are nonetheless well handled by Paolini in creating a highly readable and entertaining story.  While Paolini may not be a creator of totally new concepts, he certainly shows himself skilled at adaptation and improvisation, building a good read out of old materials.The reader will easily recognize many influences on the author as he created the novel Eragon.  Anne McCaffrey's series of novels about the dragonriders of Pern are an obvious influence, but I believe that J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels have had even a greater influence than McCaffrey's works.  Some parallels with J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories can be argued, and the 'Evil Empire' against which the rebels struggle evokes images of the Star Wars motion pictures.  Readers familiar with these various sources will quickly see Paolini's Brom as the counterpart of Tolkien's Gandolf.  Paolini's Urgals are dead ringers for Tolkien's Orcs.  The Elfin race goes by the same name in both Paolini and Tolkien.  Paolini's two Ra'zacs remind one of Tolkien's nine Nazgul.  The words that Eragon uses to lift stones and cast destruction on his enemies suggest the magic of Rowling's Harry Potter.  And on and on go the parallels.Paolini's strength, however, lies not in the direct retelling of any of his source materials but in the adaptation of the sources' character types to his own ends.  His novel is not a close variation of any of his sources' story lines but is his own creation.  That the reader recognizes others' characters reborn in Paolini's work actually makes them even more endearing.  Here are some of the old friends that we first met in other books reborn into a new environment and a different time.  Their resurrection is pleasant and we are happy to see them in action once more.Unhappily, a very few grammatical errors found their way past both the author and his proofreaders. While these are but few, they still assault readers' sensibilities and leave behind a most unpleasant residue in their minds. In each instance, these involve the use of the first person objective case pronoun when use of the nominative case is appropriate. These would probably not be so jarring were overall usage elsewhere in the novel less excellent.In sum, I believe that those who have has enjoyed McCaffrey's dragonrider novels or Tolkien's Lord of the Rings will also enjoy Paolini's Eragon.  If one has read neither McCaffrey nor Tolkien but still enjoys an adventure fraught with peril, magic, a few monsters, and a sentient dragon, then I would still feel safe in recommending Paolini.  On the other hand, if a reader seeks classical conflict, detailed character development, and the relief of an effective denouement at the end of it all, then he probably shouldn't be looking for a novel in the modern science fiction genre in the first place! I am anticipating Paolini's next novel in what he calls the Inheritance Triology with eagerness.nds that we first met in other books reborn into a new environment and a different time.

        "body": "Pro: It gets steadily better and more exciting towards the end. For a teenager, this is amazing, but there is another book I read by a teenager which is better, except I've forgotten the name.Con:The writing is sometimes clunky, dragons are too perfect-not in personality, but the author keeps on saying that dragons are mysterious and stuff so that when they do totally amazing things like create diamonds out of nowhere he can just use that as an excuse, Eragon has too many powers-a lot of the time the authors states something along the lines of 'wow, what you did in X days normally takes a person X months/years', the characters are unlikeable, and most importantly, it's excruciatingly unorginal.Now, I'm not a big fan of Lord Of The Rings, so I've only read the books once. But even I can tell that several things are stolen from LoTR, Ursula K. Leguin, and fantasy in general. The twists aren't surprising at all for someone who reads enough books-not just fantasy-to know all of the cliches. And it irks me that they don't even bother to make Eragon just born powerful, he's special because he is named after this really powerful guy (obvious, much?) and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a prophecy about his birth too. -.-Still, for a teenager it's good and toward the end it's exciting enough for me to want to read the next book.",

It just goes to show that you need more than the stereotypical `hero quest' parts to make a good story.

        "title": "Darn good start...",
        "body": "There are two ways to look at this book, I think. One is from the standpoint of a new fantasy novel. The other is from the standpoint of a new fantasy novel written by someone so young. I'll say this right now: It is a great start for an author so young. It's pretty amazing someone going through the latter teenage years had the vision and dedication to write a novel like this.But just because he's still a teen doesn't protect him from the criticisms of having a major novel on shelves next to J.K. Rowling and Tom Clancy and other popular authors.Paolini borrows from other stories...a lot. I caught homages to Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars, The Matrix, and of course, the Dragonriders of Pern series. I was able to accept this throughout the book. These stories are probably all the kid knows. He's bound to borrow from them. At times, it was tiring. At times, it made me smile. I think it's cute how one can tell how Paolini has cast himself in the part of Eragon. And, later in book, his description of Ajihad seems to be of none other than Morpheus from The Matrix. The question remains then: Was he able to craft a compelling story of his own from these elements?I think he achieved this to a point. Ultimately, I was bored through a lot of the book. I read a review which said there wasn't as much travelling as in Lord of the Rings. Are you kidding me? Most of this book is just that, travelling from one location to another. It seems like Paolini drew a map of his imagined world of Alagaesia and wanted to show as many of the locations as he could in 500 pages, while purposely leaving some areas a mystery for future novels. There were many chapters dedicated to the journey and only single chapters here and there about the destinations.A good bit of the book was also very formulaic, something I expected from someone Paolini's age, and which reflects how much he borrowed from other stories. This made much of the book predictable, and slow to read through.That said, I have one big positive remark, as well. I wondered as I read the book whether I would want to go on to his second book, Eldest, when it comes out. By the end of Eragon, I had decided I would want to. The story is nice enough and intriguing enough for me to want to find out what happens to the characters after the final pages. I am also looking forward to seeing if his writing matures, or if this book was the one good bullet in his gun, the rest all blanks.I say good luck to you, Christopher.

Young Mister Paolini, while obviously a fan of reading fantasy, should be cautioned that it takes more than that to be able to write good fantasy.  As the subject matter has become mired in cliche over the decades, what now distinguishes good fantasy is a mastery of language, of plot construction, and of character development.  In Eragon, the title character is far from sounding his age and lacks the natural bewilderment expected of a young boy thrust into epic destiny (see David Edding's Belgariad).  The use of dragons and mental communication is nothing that hasn't been done, and the so-called plot twists are all too predictable.  The writing itself is clumsy, as one might expect from a 15 year old boy.  Even the naming conventions and attempt at inventing languages bear the signs of one who reads but sadly cannot duplicate Tolkien's craft.  On the bright side, future books from Young Paolini, who must be getting older and more experienced as he enters into his twenties, can only improve on this beginning.",

Given that the author was in his teens when he wrote it, one has to give him credit.  Beyond that, though, it was nothing special.  The editorial reviews are correct when they find elements similar to McCaffrey and Terry Brooks; I was also reminded of the Dragon Riders in Raymond Feist's Magician, but in no way does the caliber of writing approach any of these authors.  It is certainly not 'comparable to Tolkien' except for similar kinds of characters which appear (elves, dwarves, 'urgals').My sister thought the plot was very similar to Star Wars, and upon examination, she is absolutely correct ...The writing is sometimes disjointed, with extraneous information the reader files away thinking it may be useful - but it isn't (perhaps in the next novel?).  There is some quite graphic violence in a book that seems to be marketed to younger people.  The 'ancient language' for the magic is rather tedious to read and not very convincing.  The descriptive similies fall somewhat flat at times; one example is 'White mist wafted up from the surface of the river, like blood steaming in winter.'  ?I would get this one out of the library if it interests you but don't waste your money on the hardcover with the pretty dragon on it.  I will probably read the next one; perhaps as the author matures he will be able to hone his writing and really make something that holds together.",

Instead I found that the book was just to my liking. The way that the story progresses was abolutly wonderful. (I'll try not to give any of the story away so people can discover the wonders of the book for themselves).  Eragon is a rich tale of a boy and dragon who must make the hardest decision that he will ever face, fight on the side of the Varden (good guys), fight with the Empire (bad side), or choose to fight on no side at all. Each choice will mean a diffrent outcome in the way that is being fought. The people that Eragon encounters on his epic quest are shroweded in mystery, leaving you wondering what the real truth is about them.  After the first time that you start reading this excellent novel you will never be able to put it down. The story line will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the ending only leaves you wanting to dive right in to the sequal to this book, The Eldest, which I have been waiting to come out since I finished reading Eragon for the first time.

The Spine is a mountain range covered with a dense forest.  On the other side of the Spine is the great sea.  The Spine follows the sea all the way down to where the sea cuts inland.  Few are those who can survive in the Spine for more than a day or two.  Eragon is one of the few who can survive in the feared mountains.  He hunts there for food for his Uncle Garrow, Cousin Roran, and himself.  While hunting, a strange stone appears deep in the Spine.  Eragon tries to use the stone to buy meat from the butcher, Sloan. Sloan, who lost his wife in the Spine and is terrified of the place, refused to sell to Eragon when he found out where the stone had come from.  The blacksmith, Horst, comes in and buys all of Sloan's best meat, giving it to Eragon.  Eragon brings the stone home and puts it in his room.  The stone turns out to be an egg and hatches into a blue baby dragon after a couple of days.  Eragon hides the dragon, which he names Saphira, in the Spine.  The king, King Galbatorix, sends his servants, the Ra'zac, to retrieve Saphira's egg.  They destroyed Uncle Garrow's house and killed Uncle Garrow.  Brom the Storyteller, who lived in Carvahall, goes with him to help him seek revenge upon the Ra'zac.  Along the way, Brom teaches Eragon the skills of the Dragon Riders.  The Dragon Riders ruled before Galbatorix became king.  A dragon egg hatches when the dragon senses the most suitable human or elf enters the presence of the egg.  The Dragon Riders ruled through protection and fairness.  All of this and much more was taught to Eragon.  Will Eragon be able to learn the appropriate skills before the time comes to confront the Ra'zac?  How does Brom know so much? I think this is a good book full of suspense and mystery. There is fighting and friendship. I think all of these are good qualities.  I don't like the fact that this book is so much like Lord of the Rings at the beginning. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and mystery, because there is a lot of both in this book.

It is combined with many other books including The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars, The Chronicles of Narnia... need I go on?So, if your looking for a book different and refreshing, this is not the one. However, if you're looking for a good fantasy book, this is recomended.",

        "body": "Last winter... I checked Eragon out from the library. About 50 or some pages in, I finally closed the book, put it down, and returned it to the library.Just as a baseline, here are some fantasy-ish books I read: Rowling, Tolkien, McCaffrey, Diana Wynne Jones, Lloyd Alexander.... some Tamora Pierce, Lawrence Watt-Evans, a little Terry Pratchett.... Roald Dahl, Bruce Coville, Arthur C. Clarke (ok, sci-fi)...So. Eragon. It... wasn't that good. The first few pages almost made me retch with its awful inexperienced writing. Some sort of big scary troll things were being described; or rather, the writer was doing his very best to describe how scary they were.Quite honestly, the writing was right out of some ill-written amature fanfic (although the spelling was better). But I decided to give the book a chance, and plowed on. I mean, I've read many online fanfics; good fanfics, very well written fanfics, and a bunch of bad fanfics. I'm used to all sorts of writing, and I know some fanfics can get unexpectedly better as they continue.Anyway, the book Eragon. I dragged my way through the first few pages... then, I think it got kind of interesting... I don't remember too well... Mainly I remember how grating the writing was. Reading Eragon was like trying to chew on sand-sprinkled spinach. Besides the pure writing style, a lot of other reasons have been covered already; ie, too much of Eragon came from somewhere else. For instance, the relationship described between the boy and the dragon -- the very word structure, I swear, could've been lifted out of McCaffrey's Dragonrider books.And for some reason, I was supposed to think that blue dragon was wonderful. Well, that dragon was blah, I didn't get that dragon's personality, I couldn't figure out if that dragon had a coherent personality at all, and I couldn't understand why the protagonist fellah Eragon or whoever was so smitten by the dragon. I wasn't connecting to this Eragon world at all. I finally gave up reading the book.(Since I got turned away too early, I won't try to review the plot.)I hear a movie is being made of this book. That just gives me the chills. But... Then again, there are a number of very nice movies based on awful books. We'll see.So like I mentioned in the review's title. If you want to read the book, get it from the library. Save money! And if you can't get through the book, you won't feel so bad.ting to this Eragon world at all. I finally gave up reading the book.

But before reading this i would recomend reading Harry Potter and the Wheel Of Time so you have and idea of what good Fantasy is.i will admit it was entertaining but anyone who gives this 5 stars needs to read a Game of Thrones by George RR Martin and know what quality fantasy is. This is not quality, it is some kid trying to scrape money together to pay for college and taking the easy way out without making his book worth reading.",

It had all of the same elements as every other bland fantasy book, along with the extra baggage of a teen-aged writer trying to flex underdeveloped vocabulary muscle--one gets the feeling that Paolini wrote the book with his high school vocabulary lists on one side, a dictionary on the other, and classic fantasy books in his lap.  The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, and the reader finds it hard to care about any of the characters because they're not well developed.  One of the review blurbs on the dustjacket's back calls Eragon a 'precocious debut.'  I think that's true; but Paolini's quite aware that he's out of his league, and tries to compensate for his uninspired vision by using big words as well as stereotypic characters and generic action sequences.  Unless Fox makes some drastic changes in dialogue and character development in its upcoming film adaptation, the movie will flop due to poor critical reviews and snickering, exhasperated audiences.  Hopefully the rest of the planned trilogy will improve the story and make 'Inheritance' worth the readers' time and money.",

        "body": "With Eragon, Paolini ventured into a flooded market of fantasy books. As many have commented in previous 'reviews', Paolini's book does have some similarities to Tolkien and other prominent fantasy writers. But with so many fantasy books, it is difficult, if not impossible, to write something completely original. Paolini's work is obviously inspired by the Lord of the Rings, but instead of copying Tolkien's format, he wanders off into his own land, with its own history and own uniqueness. For that, I applaud him.While reading this book, I was immersed into Paolini's, characters, story and world. I began feeling the emotions that the protagonist was experiencing in the story. Is that not the job of a writer? On this level, I believe Paolini was quite successful.However, when I read Eragon as a writer reads, I see some problems with his composition. The most glaring issue is his dialogue. The dialogue itself doesn't have the punch that I would have hoped and it seems as though he tried to come up with as many ways possible to say 'Eragon said.' The true power of the dialogue should be what is said, not how it is said.Finally, I have an issue with some of the other 'reviews' of Eragon. The trouble with previous reviews is that adults are putting adult perspectives on a book that is intended for students and kids. Overall, I would recommend this book. It is entertaining and it kept me reading. Kids looking for something to fill the LOTR void will enjoy this book; they will look forward to its sequels. As a teacher, I know that kids will appreciate this book and accept it for what it is: a good young adult fantasy book.",

Instead, I'll add that the pacing of the story was great, the writing was tight and intelligent, and the characters were quite likable and believable.  Sure there were hiccups here and there, but to give credit where credit is due, the author has accomplished something most writers more than twice his age have not -- the publication of a rolicking good story that's on the best seller lists and quite in demand at the library.

The plot was clearly a patchwork of influences, from Star Wars to Eddings to Tolkien. A farmboy with a destiny who lost his parents flees his little village with a storyteller who isn't all he appears... sound familiar? Somehow in the span of a few chapters, he becomes a blade master and magician. The magic is a copy, and even the scene where he releases his gift (with the blue fire) isn't original (see Queen of Sorcery). The only real difference from any story that I've read is that this boy has a dragon, who he is mentally linked to, he being a 'Rider.' The story itself plods along, and it seems that Eragon blacks out at the end of every chapter. Saphira was a little amusing, but only a little. The non-human races are Tolkien copies, with boisterous dwarves and the almost-divine elves. Some of the plot lines are a little unbelievable, even for a fantasy. Arya emerges from a coma after weeks of dying by slow poison, and in one night is fit enough to duel Eragon? Please! Hopefully book two will make up for this a little more, but honestly, I think I can already figure out the connection between Eragon and Murtagh, so I won't be keeping my fingers crossed.",

I enjoyed the fast paced story with the mystical quality of the characters; Eragon the farm boy who is more than he seems, Brom the mysterious old man who turns out to be the mentor, Saphira the blue scaled dragon and the list goes on.  Paolini has written a book that is easy to follow with dialogue that is good, but sophmoric and perfect for young adults.  It is quite an accomplishment that this author began this book at age 15 years old!  The one problem with this story is that much of it is 'lifted' from other profound and great works of fantasy fiction.  I'm stating it positively and saying it's a tribute to the great authors that so many plot themes are repeated (...) Beyond that, I truly enjoyed this well thought out, imaginative and exciting story of the farm boy who becomes a hero.  Looking forward to reading the next installments!",

I also predict the appearance of a talking tree, perhaps with a similar name to it's LOTR counterpart.We have an Arwen the elf character. (the elves even come from across the sea in this book)We have a Gimli the dwarf character, as well as the underground city of the dwarves.We of course have the Orcs (called Urgals in this book)as well as 'super-orcs' called Kull (Ura-kai)There's Brom, Gandalf the wizard's cloneThere's even an Aragorn persona, who, like Aragorn, also happens to be the son of a mighty father who is fleeing his destiny.And we even have the evil magical tyrant, just like Sauron!This being said, the book itself is entertaining, especially if you haven't read anything by Tolkien.

I wouldn't wipe my @$$ with it...<BR>  All you kiddies writing in with 5 star reviews should go back to your D+D  and Magic games and leave book reviewing to people who can actually drive cars. Pathetic.",

In fact I'm an Arabic guy, so you can imagine the big burden I went through that made me a regular reader despite the language difficulties and my hatred for books.This book was the main cause for my change and I'm really grateful for Christopher Paolini this wonderful piece of art! it took me three days to finish this book, and for me as I mentioned above, that is a MIRACLE! you can't imagine how much I yearn for The Eldest now, unfortunately I will be on a holiday back in my country when it comes out. But I will buy it as soon as I set my feet here back from my holiday.I can't deny the great amount of flowery words in each page. It gave me a headache using my dictionary to find out what they mean every minute, it was the main reason for taking three days reading the book. Sometimes I just found it unnecessary to use such words for simple things.However, it was worth it by all means and I enjoyed this book SOOOOOOO MUCH!",

This book had nothing to motivate me to finish it or even care how it ends. A good fantasy book should be a treat to read and should draw you into the story wishing it would never end. This book does not. My advice to Mr. Paolini: Get some fresh material and than maybe you'll earn the respect of hardcore fantasy readers.",

Don't get me wrong, I love my classic writers and I love reading things that are deep and timeless, but Paolini's story is one that you can just enjoy curled up by the fire.

You laugh with them, you cry with them, and at the same time trying to unveil the true identities of several key characters leaves you hungering for the next chapter, and of course, for the next book!

Sure, there were times where I would like to smack the boy on the head for his stupidity, but alas, I relate to his brashness -- your proverbial 'Kids will be kids.'  And of course the cliches, but more on that later.I loved Paolini's characterization. I am big on the belief that character's make the story.  Eragon, Saphira, Brom, and even that herb witch Angela with her werecat were fun and intriguing.Plot-wise, I will admit, it was a bit cliched -- I mean, come on, farm boy's life is turned upside down when baddies come and wreck his home; he sets off on a fantastical journey with some old dude (his guide!); he meets a mysterious (and beautiful) lover-to-be.  Yes, that is a bit ... overdone, but like I said, characters make the story and because Paolini did a good job making his characters interesting, I had no problem overlooking the myriad of cliches.  Now-a-days it is quite hard to think up an original idea without relying on past works for inspiration so do give this young writer a break for seemingly stealing ideas or whatever -- it's been done plenty of times and there are things called archetypes!All-in-all, I enjoyed Eragon and am looking forward to the next book.",

After I had finished this book, I thought about it a little and realized that I could have easily fit the plot onto 1 page, and in the middle of the book I saw that not much had happened.

And all the names are so unimaginative that I'm torn between laughing and crying at the travesty (a blue dragon named Saphira? Come on!). It's pretty much a cliched travelogue. Ugh.

For starters, come up with not-so-obivious names instead of Arya(Arwen) and Eragon(Aragorn, Dragon). secondly, don't make your magical creatures so obivious such as Urgals, elves, dwarves and shades. Thirdly, make your dialogue mature but at the same time don't struggle with its maturity, because your dialogues have the feeling that some are mature, while others sounded foolish.  Magical creatures doesn't have to be Elves, Dwarves and dragons only, stretch your own imagination, find some Other more original magical creatures, I'm sure you can do it with your writing skill. but you need to improve your story-telling skill.",

I just wanted to get on and see when the second one that he is writing is supposed to come out.

One I've read Lord of the Rings twice and I didn't notice drastic similarities. Maybe I was to engrossed in the story but you should be too. Also Eragon and Aragorn while sound alike didn't strike me as having anything to do with each other. I thought it was cool and that was one of the first things that struck was the fact that the book was about a boy and dragons and the main character's name was spelled like dragons only instead of a 'd' he used the next letter in the alphabet. There was also two other books mentioned that I've never read so can't argue about. But I mean what you've read will end up leaking into you're writing a little bit. It's only to be expected. I really liked it and thought that it was very original. I think it's cool that someone so young can get a book published. I'm thirteen and want to be an author and I am trying to write a book (I doubt it will go anywhere but you never know) so I think it's really cool that he can get this published. So go read it. It's Eragon, don't forget because then you won't be able to find and READ IT! It was SO SO SO good. Now I'm going to go back to trying to find when the next one comes out. Toodles.",

I love the little details that the author throws in. Even a simple adjective can make a sentence seem so much more interesting. Who cares if it could of been better? THIS GUY WROTE IT WHEN HE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! Give him a break. I loved this book, so even if he was a 50-year-old loser I would still stand my ground. So read it, despite these OTHER reviews.Eragon is about a boy named Eragon who finds a mysterious blue stone in the mountains. Later he finds that it is a dragon egg! The dragon grows quickly, and soon Saphira(the dragon) and Eragon are off on a great adventure... That is really the main plot, and  saying anything else will probably ruin it for you.So overall this is a great book. Though no doubt it could have been done better by another, more mature author, I still adored this. Read it!",

First off, as a Christian myself, I am sick and tired of all thes ridiculous religious fanatics ripping on Harry Potter and every other book with magic in it.  I feel sorry for you people because your absolutelymissing the entire point!  These books have wonderful moral themes that every kid and adult should learn from.  If all you see is evil in magic and miss the whole point of the book then you are saddly missing a great adventure.  For crying out loud the greatest Christian philosopher and theologist of our time was CS Lewis.  Did he use magic in his stories? hm?also,  to the person who complained about the structure of Eragon being an editors nightmare.  Have you read LOTR?  He broke every rule in the book for having a best selling novel, it's terrible to follow, he spends pages endlessly describing and it's ridiculously long, and still...people love it.  including me.  Propper isn't always right.So if your not a half-witted nerf herder and you have an open mind and enjoy a good story, Eragon is for you!What makes a good book is Characters you can relate too, and a good story.  Eragon has both of these.  Read and enjoy!",

I finished the new Harry Potter before the end of my vacation and ran into a book store to grab one.  Having not much time the clerk suggested this book.  Seeing it was in the young adult section with books I didn't even enjoy as a child (being too silly sometimes)...I was in doubt as to whether it was worth the money.  However, I was in a rush so took it, all the while returning home regretting buying a book that was aimed for those younger than the typical HP fan.I will say that the saying 'never judge a book by it's cover' stands true.  This book is by far one of the most impressive books I have read in this genre.  Fantasy is not my prefered genre so I am choosy.  I am amazed that a man so young can write such a captivating book!!! It is well structured and fluid which is a definate must for books that are of a 'fantasy' nature.All in all I say read it even if you are not a big fantasy fan.  If you like HP or the Phillip Pullman trilogy then this will be your cup of tea!  The only thing I will say is that I wouldn't let my younger relatives read this because within the first few pages there are many deaths so I say caution to parents of children 12 and under.",

So all i have to say is. If you dont like this book, you have no good taste in fantasy, becouse ive read alot of fantasy and this really 'takes the cake'. So i know that there are alot of people who dont like this book.3 words. Your All Crazy. I may only be 9 but i think that this is a really really really good book even if it may have some cussing.

        "body": "This book is proof that in today's publishing world, a good story sells--but that story doesn't necessarily have to be in the book itself. Everyone knows that Christopher Paolini was only 15 when he started writing Eragon, and after self-publishing the book Knopf picked it up and it became a bestseller. Which is impressive for someone of Paolini's age. But.That still doesn't mean Eragon is a great book. I found the writing to be rather flat and contrived in places, especially toward the beginning as Paolini struggled to get this beast in motion. Although the book does show gleams of originality, most of it feels like it has been cobbled together with bits and pieces of favorite--and better written--fantasy.Eragon is a simple, young farm boy on the verge of manhood. Yawn. He doesn't know who his father is and his mother disappeared after his birth. Eyeroll. Out hunting one day, Eragon finds a mysterious blue stone that turns out to be a dragon egg. After the egg hatches for Eragon, it turns out that there are nasty things hunting said egg. As can be expected, bad things happen and soon Eragon is off on a journey of discovery and vengeance, accompanied by the village storyteller Brom, who is more than what he seems. (And whose identity, though Paolini takes great pains trying to make it a great secret, will be blatantly obvious to anyone with half a brain.)At times, some heart and soul really does shine out of this novel, and there were moments when I forget that I was reading the uneven work of a 15 year old. Paolini shows promise, I'll give him that. However, for the most part, Eragon reads like an elaborate fanfiction written by a Lord of the Rings obsessed homeschooler who has been coddled into thinking he can write. Perhaps Paolini will have matured into a more even style and less contrived plot in the series' next installment, Inheritance.",

As an avid fantasy reader I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, whether it be fantasy or not.  To those of you who stress out about the small things, such as the similarities to other authors and obvious clues Eragon should be picking up on, I recommend you get out of your mom's basement and put the dungeons and dragons board away (or whatever it is you use to play the game)!

This story possibly merits 150 pages, and yet here it is told in 544. By assuming that his audience has no imagination, the author annoys and alienates. I find it highly pathetic that reviewers are fawning over Mr. Paolini and his work as if it's something special, or even worth reading. I strongly believe in the potential of young people to achieve, and yet this author's poor style and quick fame, far from advancing generational equality,  has underscored more worthy attempts of others. I have hopes that Mr. Paolini's creativity and ability will grow, and that his future books will be more original and improved stylistically; however, his first attempt is a waste of a reader's time.

It is the story about a fifteen-year-old farm boy named Eragon who discovers a mysterious blue stone in the forest near his home. At first, Eragon intends to sell it for much-needed money, but when a very rare and powerful dragon hatches from the 'stone', Eragon is immediately thrown into an adventure that he isn't prepared for! He's forced to flee his village with his dragon, Saphira, and an old storyteller, Brom, after his grandfather is brutally murdered. Before long, Eragon finds himself unwillingly at the center of an ongoing war between elves, dwarves, men, primitive Urgals, fiendish Shades, and the evil King Galbatorix.With elves, dwarves, magic, and all of the other fantasy elements in the story, it's impossible to ignore the similarities between this book and the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. But, even so, 'Eragon' is still a very entertaining book with plenty of originality. Christopher Paolini uses the perfect amount of detail to make the story incredibly believable, but not so much that the story drags on longer than it needs to. Though there were a few slow parts, especially in the beginning, there was enough suspense built up to keep you reading and wondering about what would happen next. All of the main characters in 'Eragon' have their own unique personalities, and the way they interact with each other makes them seem very real. Actually, though 'Eragon' is obviously a fantasy book, many aspects of it were quite realistic, such as Eragon's numerous self-doubts and weaknesses: two things that main characters often lack. Even the made-up geography and languages of Paolini's world are very intricate and well thought-out.The only thing that might annoy some people about 'Eragon' is that it's very complicated and often confusing at times. There over fifty different names of people, places, and animals that are used throughout the story, so if it weren't for the glossary and maps in the back of the book, I would have been hopelessly lost! But if you really enjoy reading fantasy/adventure stories like 'Lord of the Rings', then you shouldn't let that stop you from reading 'Eragon'! The continuous excitement and suspense will surely keep you hooked throughout the whole first part of Eragon's long journey!t weren't for the glossary and maps in the back of the book, I would have been hopelessly lost!

Of course, if you make your list of other authors and novels large enough, and you read into 'Eragon' hard enough, you will be able to find examples of other works imbedded in 'Eragon'.  However, these imbedded pieces are merely well-established facets of fantasy that Paolini abides by, just as Tolkien did decades ago, and authors have as well.  'Eragon' is far from being full of predictable and boring plots, emotionless dialogue, and unrelenting clich&eacute;s.  Having read all three of J.R.R Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' novels multiple times, I can honestly say I enjoyed 'Eragon' much more.  The story is written in an enjoyable style that doesn't require you to run for your dictionary every time an archaic word is uttered or bombastic language is unnecessarily used.  It would seem that some of today's contemporary authors like to inflate their egos by injecting high-class vocabulary into their works when simpler terms would have sufficed; this is not so with Paolini's 'Eragon'. The story advances at a refreshing pace without lingering on any one aspect more then is necessary, and all key characters present in 'Eragon' are properly fleshed out.  Simply put, 'Eragon' is a solid fantasy novel that deserves the praise it receives.",

        "body": "I absolutely loved this book.  It really is worth the trouble to read it is in my opinion beter than the Lord of the Rings series.  The author uses lots of details when describing everything that happens to characters in the book.  He makes them sound so real that you can see them and really get inside their heads.  I think Christopher should hurry up and write the next book in the inheritance series.  He is one of the best fantasy authors around and i think he has a long career ahead of him.",

I found it a pleasure to read, and I was surprised that an author so young (15) could come up with such a well-rounded, sensible, entertaining fantasy book. Of course, he draws heavily from LOTR and other epic classics, and even some Harry Potter, but I do not think this novel is meant to be approached with a critical eye. Just enjoy it!",

I dont care if there are some mistakes like the first review said. I just read to have fun and ENJOY the book. This is a great book for the beginners, and if your just starting up with the genre it is a great book that you will have fun raeding for a week. For experts great book just to sit down and read it when you want to be in a good mood.",

        "title": "Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars",
        "body": "This is a fantastic book. It is not going to be a literary classic in the sense that it will one day be a great piece of literature to be taught and studied, but it is certainly able to hold its own with the science fiction and fantasy world today. I was randomly in a book shop when I found this book on the counter and for some reason, was compelled to buy the nice hardcover though I had NO idea what it was about. Having read it, it follows the quest path of and introduces new characters above what one sees in the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien. It also has a Star Wars resemblance in that Eragon is the new generation of an extinct order of extremely capable peacekeepers. For anyone who loves dragons, elves, and a very well written battle which has you on the edge of your seat, this is the book to sit down and enjoy. The author is able to keep you going through the story with the sign of most good books: that you don't separate the you in the chair from the you viewing the action. It is a challenging read too for those of you who are tired of being fed everything in a book. While many novels reintroduce the tid bits that are going to mean something, you can go a few hundred pages without being reintroduced to a part of the story that it turns out, was more significant later. I just finished the first book and I am still tingling with anticipation of starting the next.",
