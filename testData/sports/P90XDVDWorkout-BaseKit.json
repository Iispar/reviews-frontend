        "body": "I love these videos... they are effective and all... but they are long! I don't have a problem with doing the videos when I'm off work but its difficult after I work a 12 hour shift (I'm a nurse) to do them. I actually tried to do it prior to going to work but it's just really difficult. I had to wake up at 4 am to do them because they are so long... then going to work and sometimes not getting off until 8pm makes for a really long day. That's only 5-6 hours of sleep after you account for work and workout. I don't know how some people managed to get this done in 90 days.I guess you can always improvise and do half the workout before and half the workout after... or even if you just did half the workout on the days you work... anything is better than nothing.The workout themselves are advanced in some videos. I find that I am capable of doing most of them and some things I have to improvise. I consider myself to be semi-athletic. I am overweight but not foreign to working out and I used to play sports in my younger years. I find that even after a week or two of doing the moves you can already see a difference in your performance and what you are capable of doing.Just in a week I've already seen a 4 pound drop...that's also following the diet provided.Overall, with the holidays that just passed and working 4-5 days (12-hour shifts) I find it impossible to keep up with... but perhaps I should work less to make this a priority for it to work.",

I was in decent shape all ready.  Was able to do the program. On P90X you will lose weight, get ripped, and look skinny strong if that is what you want.  I love it for what it does and use it 4 days a week.  I do not do Kempo.  But the legs are good, Yoga is great, a little cardio, and the best is push ups and pull ups.  I highly recommend you do this program.  Forget all the technical reviews, positive or negative.  This is plain working our and anyone who does this will see noticeable improvement.  IT IS HARD, period.  And for the much needed narcissistic motivation, regardless of how good of shape you are in, your friends and family will notice.  In my case because I lost muscle mass and leaned up.  If you think your a badd ass, do this and prove it to yourself.  If you can do pull ups and push ups with these guys, well then you very well may be.",

        "title": "Great workouts for the money",
        "body": "I'm currently rounding out week two of the P90X program.  After about a year of doing little to no exercise I had put on a fair amount of weight and my fitness level had diminished considerably.  Before my year long hiatus I used to mountain bike, road bike, rock climb, snow board, hike, run, etc.  I heard good things about P90X from other people trying it, and from the reviews online from a variety of sources.  The program is definitely effective and gets you to work, but there are pros and cons just like everything else.The workouts are designed to push you.  You've definitely not going to be able to do everything the first couple of weeks unless you're in athlete level fitness.  If you're like me and haven't done much activity in a long time you're going to be really sore the first couple of days, and probably achy the next couple of weeks.  You really need to try and push yourself without cause immediate pain.  Any sharp pains mean you should stop immediately, but working through achy muscles and soreness is not a bad thing and often will make ou feel better in the end.The variety the program offers is one of the better things.  I like the mix of strength, stretch, and endurance.  For intance, the Yoga routine while hard has a bunch of stretches at the end that losens everything up after all the strength routines earlier in the week.  Going into week three I think most of my muscle soreness should be gone, and won't return until week 5 when the routine switch up again.  Also, if you're not sore at all after the strength routine you're either doing something wrong, or are not working hard enough.  Soreness = results.There are some cons to the program.  P90X requires a couple pieces of equipment on top of the $140 DVDs.  You'll need a pull-up bar, and weights or bands at a bare minimum.  They also recommend yoga blocks, yoga mat, heart rate monitor, and a myriad of P90X branded suppliments.  If you're on the cheap I recommend getting the bands.  You local sporting goods store should have some in stock.  You're going to need a couple of different bands for different exercises.  If you're a guy, I'd recommend a 30lb-50lb band range.  As for dumbbells, they'll cost ~$1/lb, you could probably get away with just a couple, but as your strength increases you'll just end up needed different ones.  If you can afford it I've read the Bowflex Selectech weights work well for 90% of the exercises.  Pretty much any pull-up bar would work, but ones that have the wide grips would suit the workouts better.  As for everything else, it's not really needed. For suppliments I would suggest going to a GNC and getting something with similar nutritional properties as the P90X products.  The heartrate monitor is usefull, but not required.  The yoga blocks don't need to be actual yoga blocks.  A small cardboard box would do the exact same job to help you balance and extend your reach.As of right now noticing any changes is hard.  One thing I would recommend for people if they want to see results is to get a scale that measures body fat, and skeletal muscle.  Omron sells one that is pretty accurate and has a 90day memory that can help to track you progress through out the program.  Don't get discouraged if the pounds aren't just flying off.  At first you're building muscle, which is heavier than fat, so you might actually gain a couple pounds initially.  Over time, the increased muscle mass will have a higher caloric demand than your body did before and will consume more calories even while resting resulting in fat loss.  The key is to stick it out and keep working.  The way this program works is by keeping you in motion and working hard.  Any program saying you'll see overnight changes is a scam.  You have to work for your results just like everything else in live.tting the bands.  You local sporting goods store should have some in stock.

If you actually give this program a chance and do it every day and follow the nutrition plan, it will definitely work for you. You will feel your mood change just after about three days into the program and realize how what you eat affects your mood and alertness. Give it a chance! It really works! And you can do it at home!

        "body": "First off, let me say that I am a very fit person.  I'm athletic and have done hundreds of workout videos and various programs over the years.  I run, I bike, I swim.  I love being fit and healthy.  I was excited to try P90x b/c I like Tony Horton and because I like new challenges -- however, after starting the P90X Lean program, I noticed a lot of soreness immediately in my shoulder and neck area especially-- the next day I completed the CardioX -- both of these workouts contain a move called The Dreya Roll and also something called a Superman/Banana.  The next day I couldn't move my neck or shoulders at all, seriously.  I was in excruciating, and I mean excruciating, pain for about 3 or 4 days or so -- It was just horrible.  I know absolutely that those two moves are responsible for all of my torn muscles.  These moves are completely dangerous and stupid.  Needless to say I didn't bother doing any more of the workouts.  These moves put incredible strain on your upper back and shoulders and neck area -- not good at all and downright stupid.  Workouts should be challenging but they should not injure you.  In and of themselves the moves are ok and I guess if you skip those it would be ok too but put them all together in one 'supermove' and you're looking at a bad injury which will put you out of commission for days. I'm sticking with Jillian Michaels and my various other routines (I love TurboFire btw) -- I have never once gotten an injury from a JM workout. not ever -- They are incredibly hard and challenging workouts -- BUT they don't injure you and that is key.  Jillian knows her stuff and I think Tony does also but those moves are totally dangerous and if they injured me -- a super-fit athlete my advice would be -- don't get this workout.  I'm sending mine right back.",

I was waking at 5:00 am for it, and for a month and a half did pretty well. Until I got sick(a year ago), and that kind of ended all until a month ago... I'm going to do something else which will shred lbs and is a tad faster, but to tone up and get stronger; I am going to return to the P90X and finally completely it.  I do recommend it for that.

I work out in the evening and had no problem sleeping afterward.  You will definitely get ripped if you stick with it.  I still can't complete the super short Ab Ripper work out.My wife and I chumped out before we completed the program but we're going to try again soon.  I highly recommend this over a gym membership.",

I'm a guy who used to work out a lot but with the job and getting older had lost motivation and was in what I would consider the worst shape of my life.  I'm only 3 weeks into it but am already down almost 10 and feel much better.  The workouts are interesting and tough although not impossible although I have found the yoga to be quite difficult for me.  I would highly recommend to anyone who is serious about getting into shape but not so much for the casual person.The discs arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Thank you!",

The host of the series is a completely amazing presenter and shows how to best accomplish your goals following simplified techniques for which you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars and waste your life away in a dirty, crowded gym setting. I will never go back to having a gym membership so long as this p90x series motivates me to stay in the best shape of my life.",

        "body": "I never get tired of P90X. I've completed the program probably three times in the last 5 years. I know that doesn't sound good, but I've started P90X many times. It's just that I've often had a vacation, or a sickness which ended up interrupting the 13-week program. So I just start over if I lose a week or two (or, if I get sluggish, a month).You *will* occasionally miss days while doing P90X. Missing one day a week is not a real problem, just pick up from where you left off (don't skip a workout; instead, push back your completion date). Make a point of never missing two days in a row, and try really hard never to miss more than one day a week.People often complain that the P90X workouts are long. They actually aren't as long as you'd think, because *they include warm-up and stretching and cool-down*. It's not as if you are going full bore for 60 minutes every day. The warm-up and cool-down are what make P90X such a great program for older people. I'm 49, going on 50, and I'm SO GLAD that the workouts contain all the necessary warm-up and stretching. I will be totally ripped when I turn 50, and I'll keep doing P90X or P90X2.You DO want a pull-up bar. You DO want dumbbells. You do want anti-fatigue flooring (those 2-ft by 2-ft interlocking floor mats) or carpeting. You want push-up stands too, and a strong, light chair, and a yoga mat.P90X is inspiring, educational, and cheap compared to individualized personal trainers. If you are willing to work hard, then this program is for you.",

        "body": "Very effective exercise programs that work both for active athletes and for people who haven't been to the gym in many years. I do the weight lifting routines in conjunction with my martial arts and running workouts and it is working out very nicely.    Remember that exercise alone won't get you fit. You will likely need to tweak your diet. Cut down on sugar, alcohol, red meat and grains and you will see the results much faster. Even more important than diet/exercise is getting a healthy amount of sleep every day!    What I could do without is their sleazy marketing of the synthetic pills and the 'recovery drink'. Do yourself a favor and don't buy that crap. While what they say is true, 'regular diet does not always provide all the minerals/vitamins that your body needs', you fix it by modifying your diet. They also mention 'research', but conveniently omit the fact that long-term studies have shown that synthetic vitamin pills are useless and can even be harmful. Get a good blender, throw in some fresh fruit, vegetables, seeds/nuts, ice and there's your recovery drink!    Some reviewers say, 'you need a lot of equipment'. Not really. Here's what I got in my 'home gym' setup:    [[ASIN:B002Y2SUU4 Stamina 1690 Power Tower]]    [[ASIN:B005ASREVK StairMaster Pair of TwistLock Adjustable Dumbbells (100-Pounds)]]    [[ASIN:B00C5C1F7S Manduka BLACK PRO Yoga and Pilates Mat]]    That's it.

The routines are challenging for both of us even though we have previous experience working out. We are very glad we purchased this set.  We are only 4 weeks into the program and have already noticed increased strength and stamina.  The only difficulty we had was when we first ordered the disks from Amazon one of the 13 disks wouldn't work.  We had to reorder the disks from BeachBody and return the disk set to Amazon.  It was easy and we received a complete refund.",

I started off thinking Oh no another goofy infomercial but then I really listened to what Tony had been saying and the interesting thing is I started doing what he calls Muscle Confusion a few months before I'd even seen the P90X commercial. I did a different workout dvd everyday prior to P90X. When I saw the infomercial I thought he this guy has created a system that does just that. A different well structured workout everyday. This program has changed my life.I feel more confident, beautiful (inside and out) and I look at myself and others in a more positive light. Check out the Awesome YouTube community just Type in P90X and see real people just like you and me who have made amazing transformations. Watch the video journals... everyday people show you themselves on video day one and then watch the 90 day video. No trickery just the real deal. I can even do one arm pushups something I would never in my life have imagined doing before P90X.You will also be amazed at what you can do after doing YogaX. The positions are endless and may even improve life in the bedroom. I'm way more flexible than I ever was.I can't say enough about how life changing this program is.It's worth every penny. You'll feel like you've gotten your money worth 100 times over.",

The marketing world is probably the worst enemy for serious, or would be serious fitness buffs because they buy into all the crap people talk about programs like p90X.The program is based on solid principles, and if you're willing to see it through to the end of the three months, you'll see great results. The key to a program like this is consistency. The program provides for things like recovery time, flexibility and endurance training, so it is a pretty complete package. I would recommend this workout for anyone seriously wanting to get in shape. You can do the program at your own pace, as long as you are consistent, so there's no reason you should let your current shape stop you... just take it easy if you're trying to start on this program.",

My knees gave out unexpectedly and I had recurring pain in both shoulders.  I had been careful about substituting for plyometrics and that kind of thing, but Tony still got the better of my joints.  After stopping P90X my pain level dropped immediately, but it has taken more than a year for my body to get back to it's pre-P90X function.This is a fabulous, well-rounded program.  The workouts are long and that can be difficult to schedule.  The combination of yoga, aerobic, core, and weights/resistance is brilliant.  Three weeks into the first cycle I added two inches to my biceps and no longer fit into my tailored blouses and jackets.  The results are possible.Had this workout program not mauled my body I would rate it higher and would probably still be doing it.",

The workouts within each video are intense and varied, which I really like, so that I don't get bored. As a collegiate athlete and runner, I was skeptical about DVD workouts but these are great for overall body toning and muscle building. Running only works so many muscles, but P90X works everything! The only thing I would change is add more cardio. I don't feel the 30 minute cardio workout is enough for someone like me, who is a runner. I find that I need to supplement more cardio throughout the week and I could see how someone who is very keen on losing weight might plateau if they don't get their heart rate up in every workout. But my arms and abs look great and my core feels much stronger! Perfect workout video for winter months when it's too wet or cold to run everyday.",

You don't need to spend money for a video workout routine if you have the discipline to just do it on your own, but I will say that it certainly makes it easier to get motivated when you have something to go by.I can't stand Tony Horton, and a lot of the videos are annoying, but who wouldn't think someone is annoying after you've heard them say the same thing 50 times.  I turn everything off but the cues and roll.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't have a routine and wants to work hard to get in shape.",

Secondly, if you do something half-ass, that's the results you're almost ceratinly going to get. My wife and I bought the program from the P90X website to avoid outside vendor problems. The only issue so far is that DVD 1 rattles a bit in our DVD player (hence 4 stars and not 5). You don't have to be in great shape to do the program, but the routines are not easy. Not to mention you have to actually do them. It takes us about 1.5 hours per day. Now, any good program you spend 1.5 hours per day on will likley give you positive results, but with this program all the info is provided to you- spoon feeding is our cup of tea. For roughly $150, it's worth it to us. We did throw down extra dough for a chin-up bar, weights, mats and some other goodies, but this is optional. We use a small area rug in our living room for both of us (about 6' by 10') and have found this adequate- modifications can be made. The diet suggested can also me modified using common sense. Regarding Horton's personality, we think the man's ok. We don't find him annoying or a jerk as some do. I figure as long as we stick to it and don't eat at the trough, we'll get some oustanding results. You can supplement or not- your choice. All things considered, you get what you pay for. Could you find a better program for you? Possibly. Could you do a lot worse? Absolutely. You cannot please everybody. But for us...we're happy campers. Sore, but happy. So, put down that pint of ice cream and get some exercise.",

        "body": "I've made it through 10 weeks of the program, and if you stick with it, it works. I am working through the 'Lean' program, and plan to do 'Doubles' when I finish my first 90 days.As you will probably read in other reviews, there are some good things and some bad, and a lot that is open for debate. First the negatives: It takes a lot of time, especially at first if you are not familiar with the exercises. I set aside 90 minutes for each weight-routine workout, (which inludes time for the ab routine).I was physically fit and active (I play recreational hockey), but was carrying an extra 30 pounds of fat. I found that some of the exercises were difficult at first, but trust me that it gets easier as your body begins to change. One thing that I really like about P90X is that it's a total body workout, and includes a lot of stretching and flexibility exercises, along with increasing muscle mass and replacing body fat.Here is the debatable topic - Tony Horton can be really annoying. He uses the same jokes in many of the videos and it can become tedious after a while. That being said, his mantra of 'Do your best and forget the rest' really resonated with me when I was struggling, as well as his continued encouragement that it's okay if you can't keep up with the people on the video - eventually you will. I actually kind of like the guy, in the way that you like that HR person who makes you do the trust exercise at the retreat.At this point, I can't imagine going back to the eliptical trainer four days a week. I think I'd be bored out of my mind. I look forward to my daily workouts and plan to continue with P90X for at least one more round. In ten weeks I've lost almost 20 pounds, but more importantly I have reshaped my body and gained an incredible amount of flexibility.One other point I should make. There are several diet options. I chose to count calories based on eating a specific number of portions from the various food groups (it's all in the diet book). One mistake I made, was that I did not increase my calorie intake in phase II because I was satisfied with the 1800 calories and wanted to lose more weight. Big mistake. My body went into starvation mode and I didn't lose any weight for three weeks until I increased my calories. So, I would suggest that whichever food plan you choose, stick to the guidelines unless you really know what you're doing. I didn't.So, my summary is that this program does work, but it takes a lot of time and committment. There is no substitute for hard work, but if you stick with it, you will see results, but also keep your expectations real. You're not going to go from blob to buff in 90 days.",

I can't really afford a Bo-flex home gym at the moment, and unfortunately my basement is currently being occupied by my son, whom I should mention is a total reefer-addict.Anyway, I got this P90X thing because I want to get yoked. When I walk into my next shindig for the Local 101, I want to be the most &#34;torqued&#34; guy in the room. We're talking &#34;bearmode&#34; here, bro. Unfortunately, these scams like P90X are a total waste of money, time, and protein shakes.So finally I get this box in the mail and inside the box ix the P90X stuff I was expecting. I wanted to get my swoll on early, so I did one of the workouts right there in my overalls.To say the least, it was easy. Then again, being 5&#34; 7&#34; and 220lbs at 4% bodyfat makes a lot of things easy.Anyway, realizing that I just blew $150 bucks on some useless DVDs, I decided to crank out a few more when all of a sudden my son walks upstairs and sees me.Then he calls me a &#34;hardo&#34; and leaves. I immediately went into a fit of rage and began punching holes in walls. I went into the bathroom, ripped the sink out of the wall, smashed it, and began eating the broken ceramic pieces. Don't ask me why. I was really angry and I just did.After about 5 minute I began vomiting up blood and passed out. Next thing I knew I woke up in the ER with a $4000 medical bill. My hemp-head son picked me up and drove me home.Not worth the $4150. Huge waste of greenbacks. Not a recommended buy.",

        "title": "Best all over work out system",
        "body": "I hesitated spending this much for a DVD workout, but I figured I spent several times that amount on a gym, this is a bargain. Besides, I could always resell it if I didn't like it.  This is worth every penny.  P90X works on the idea of 'confusing' your muscles, changing up exercises so your muscles don't get used to the same movements. It's a complete body workout, and it changes up day to day so you don't get bored or overwork the same area. Plus it includes yoga and cardio so you add stretching and cardio.The reason I considered this.  My best friend when I lived in NY was a professional dancer.  He could lift a fellow dancer (man or woman) over his head without breaking a sweat.  He told me -  Strength isn't about bulk, it isn't about repetition of the same movements.  To do anything that requires strength, all of your muscles have to be engaged and trained to work at their maximum and to be able to react differently for each different movement.  I always remembered this when checking out workout routines  When I came across P90X, it was the best routine for an all over workout, and challenged your muscles to constantly work differently.I recommend watching the video first before going through it, so that you know how the whole session runs before actually doing it.  Also, there may be some moves you aren't familiar with and before slamming them into a whole routine, work them out so you can get comfortable with them.  I'm not that coordinated and had a little trouble with getting some of the exercises down, especially when they change so quickly.  Watching first and practicing a little helped.  My personal recommendation is that you might want to add more stretching before and after doing the video, flexibility really helps you get more out of the exercises.  I also have carpal tunnel, so I had to modify exercises that had push ups in them.  I use push up bars to keep the stress and weight off my wrists.  [[ASIN:B002OEQ50Y Definity HHP-001 Pair of Push Up Bars]]  These are really great ones to use, sturdy, and they aren't heavy so you can do the Double Dog push ups and adjust your hands slightly for the yoga positions easily.  As far as other equipment goes, there are bands and balls and weights you can use, but you don't absolutely need them to do the exercises.  If you don't have them on hand when you get the DVD, do the exercises without and then look for the equipment that works for you.  Although I do recommend getting a good pull up bar, and one that allows for many different hand positions.You get the benefit of cross training in this system - you get elements of martial arts, boxing, yoga, and basic cardio.  And you won't get bored.  The routines change constantly, and you don't push your body to the point of muscle exhaustion.  This work out does repeat exercises, but something that is done 100 times is a quick moving exercise so the whole segment is at most a minute or so.  The sequence of the exercises is done well because even when you are working a specific muscle group in a few exercises, you go from working them through cardio to resistance, so they are being worked differently and you don't push your muscles too far.Another reason I like this system is because it does all the right things for helping you lose weight in addition to getting in shape (which was one of my goals when I bought it). You get the resistance training (building muscle burns more fat) and the cardio (which also burns fat), so your weight loss plan gets a huge help. I also supplement with [[ASIN:B0093OHLM4 Raspberry Ketone Platinum (2 Bottles) - Clinical Strength - All Natural Fat Burning, Weight Loss, Diet Supplement, 60 capsules]] before I do my workout. It gives me a ton of energy to get through my workout and additionally it has helped me lose weight faster. I have lost nearly twice as much weight per week using the Raspberry Ketone with the workouts than when I just did P90X (was losing about 1.5 - 2lbs per week without the supplement now close to 4lbs a week while using it). It is a clinical strength formula but still all-natural, which is a big plus to me. There are plenty of good fat burner/energy supplements you can use, I just found this one worked the best for me.To sum up my recommendations:Watch the videos firstPractice some of the new exercises so you know how to do them before you go through the video as a wholeDon't be too ambitious at first, do exercises without the weights, balls, bands, etc. then add them when you have the routine down, and use the equipment that works for youDon't be too ambitious at first, if you can't get through the one-day routine, break it into two or more days.

        "title": "A mix of good sense and mainstream duddery",
        "body": "P90X has been marketed as a revolutionary way to train. The packaging and marketing might be new, but at it's core P90X is a mix of well-established weights training & fat loss principles and more simplistic, mainstream solutions. Will this program help you lose fat? Yes. Will it help you build muscle? No, although you will get stronger and leaner; any other increase in muscle size will be due to increased blood flow. Will this program let you get 'ripped'? That depends on your bodyfat percentage; there's a limit to how fast you can lose fat. Summary? This is a program of moderate usefulness, but it's clouded by misinformation and poor structuring to appeal to a market. There are bigger, better and more effective things out there.    WEIGHTS PROGRAM    The weights program here is a mix of various existing principles. Each weights workout is based on a strength circuit training structure, where you complete various different exercises one after the other, sometimes repeating the circuit and then starting another. There are two basic sets of training routines used at different points, with one set using antagonistic muscle training (ie, using a push muscle group(s) and a pull muscle group(s) in the same workout), and the other using same muscle group training (ie, using only pull muscle groups or push muscle groups in a single workout). These are split across the different phases of the 90 day program.    However, whilst these types of training and tried and proven as muscle gainers, they're not very effective in this program. Why not? Well, it's a mixture of time, diet and the exercises contained within the program. This is a 3 month program - even lifting heavy weights, eating lots with a proper diet and using all the right supplements at all the right times, the best even the most genetically gifted can hope for is a kilogram of muscle growth a month.  However, this doesn't really matter if you do follow the program, because you'll be eating at a caloric deficit and losing fat. Gaining muscle and losing fat is notoriously difficult, and eating at a caloric deficit will result in small muscle losses. The weights training will, hopefully, more or less restrict the damage to minimising muscle loss, and in some cases resulting in a little bit of muscle gain.    All of this is beside the point though, because the weights program isn't too great. This is partly because of the marketing strategy, keeping everything fresh, and as a result a few of the weights programs become clogged with inefficient or unnecessary exercises. But even then, these weights programs are mostly a mix of bodyweight exercises or light weights, with the intention of making the program more cardio-oriented, as well as aiming for a 'burn'. The bodyweight exercises are great, but sooner or later you need to add weight to them otherwise it's just a matter of conditioning your Central Nervous System to repeat the same exercise, instead of getting stronger.   The lighter weights exercises are aimed at hitting the same muscles from other angles. But in keeping with the program, too many different exercises are added for some muscle groups to keep the structure, or too many new exercises are added to hit the same muscle groups for the sake of keeping things fresh.    But that's not the real problem with the weights program. The real problem is that it's implementing an advanced weights training routine. Unless you're already reasonably fit and strong, or you're a beginner or intermediate lifter, this programs complexity will be too much for your body to handle, further hampering muscle gains. This isn't a program that will be helpful to the majority of beginners, and intermediate or advanced lifters will already have more effective ways to train.    There is no guide to form. This is worrying, as some of these exercises are landmines for injury, and the potentials for such hazards are poorly explained. There is the occasional 'watch your form' from Tony, and there is the visual aid of the videos, but they're not explanations, and it's all too easy to stop paying attention and ignore those risks.    Then there's the plateau effect. P90X is marketed as a way to beat it. Instead, this program addresses the problem poorly, instead of providing a solution. People plateau because they overreach. People overreach when they push too hard too fast in the weights room either because they don't understand what they're doing or they won't leave their ego at the door. And instead of lowering the weights used and practicing proper form, people continue to do the same thing again and again. I know this, anyone who's frequented a gym will recognise the people there who've worked out for years and never made progress. Whilst changing a weights routine can often be a solution, it is not THE solution. At the very least, training and raising weights properly, nobody should plateau for a minimum of 3 months.  By contrast, P90X changes every 4 weeks, with only 3-4 consecutive weeks of the same training, with the focus on lifting as much as you can. It's pushing the same cause of the plateau effect, but changes so frequently so to hide the effects.    Well, what about the actual weights routines themselves? For a start, the weights training for legs is abysmal. Only one day a week for training what are the most powerful muscles in the human body, and all the exercises are focused on quads - no hamstring or glutes, with only ONE exercise for calves. This is, frankly, appalling - legs are often the most undertrained parts of the body, despite making up the entire lower half of our bodies. 50% of the body is instantly neglected. Furthermore, there's no change in the legs routine - you'll do the same thing for the duration of the program. Various studies have shown that training the legs - specifically, by squatting - is the most effective way of promoting Central Nervous System activity; that is, the most effective way of heightening metabolism and promoting muscle growth. That legs are neglected is scandalous.    The rest isn't so bad. The chest, back and ab exercises used are all excellent, although they offer little in the way of post-program progress. They provide various levels of variety and difficulty. There's nothing wrong with the specific exercises used in the program, though the back exercises that use weights certainly need to have form explained - keep your back straight, or else you risk the threat of a lower back injury.    Biceps, triceps and shoulders are more sketchy. Some of the exercises are good, but there's far too many repetitions of the same basic movement, and some of the exercises - especially the shoulders - risk injury if done incorrectly.    Overall, i'd say that Chest & Back, and Ab Ripper X, are both exceptional, and Shoulders, Biceps & Triceps is pretty good too. The other three weights programs aren't recommended.    CARDIO    The cardio component of P90X is one of the bright spots. It includes Plyometrics (jump training), astanga yoga and some kenpo karate, with a mix of all of these bundled together into Cardio X. Each of these is good, although the kenpo section swings far wide of the actual practice of Kenpo karate, and gets boring after a while. I personally prefer jogging, cycling or swimming to it. Plyo is great and easily the best program in this package, and yoga is marginally below that. The length of the yoga section is just over 90 minutes, however, and can be tedious.    Additionally, there is a Stretch X program complete at least once a week. This is good for recovery and flexibility, but be warned - NEVER stretch cold. You risk injury by tearing cold muscles, and it's something not properly addressed.    DIET    This is the essential part of the program. Like the weights component, it's a mixture of good and bad. It emphasises calorie counting and eating at a caloric deficit (eating fewer calories than you burn daily), as well as an emphasis on cleaner eating. Thisis the best part of the diet - eating at a caloric deficit is essential to fat loss, and it provides a platform for future dietary consideration. However, the program errs here in places, and again becomes the victim of marketability.    First off the bat - fat calories are NOT turned into body fat. Carbohydrates and fats are both natural sources of energy. You gain fat by eating too many carbohydrates and/or fats, with your body storing the excess energy as fat. There are numerous benefits to fats, including consuming essential fatty acids; they're slow digesting, so you feel fuller for longer; they're a more efficient fuel source than most carbohydrates; and they help dampen cravings.    Throughout this program, no more than 20% of dietary intake is fats. Whilst it's certainly not the worst approach, it keeps up the facade that fats are a bogey man. Personally, when I eat at a caloric deficit, my diet consists of 40% protein, 20% carbs and 40% fats.    The other main component to the diet is changing with the phases of the weights plan. This, frankly, doesn't make much sense. The diet, keeping fats consistent, begins with a 50/30/20 protein/carbs/fats split, then a 40/40/20 split, and finally a 20/60/20 split. This poses several problems. First of all, the level of protein in the last phase is too low for building or maintaining muscle. Protein is used by the body in repairing and maintaining muscle; minimum recommendations on a program where you don't want to lose muscle are 1 gram of protein (4 calories) per pound of bodyweight. Minimum. This violates that rule.  The second problem is the increase in carbs. Apart from my own personal disposition against eating too many carbs on a fat-loss diet, eating so many in the last phase doesn't make sense. The stated purpose is to give you the strength to build muscle; yet you can't build muscle without adequate protein, and eating at a caloric deficit means you won't have a sufficient amount of energy any way (by consuming less food, to be converted into energy or in the case of protein used for protein synthesis, than your body needs to function).    Additionally, increased carbs means an increase of insulin released by your body; insulin being the hormone that regulates carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body. This causes a problem because digesting more carbs results in higher releases of insulin. Basically, eating more carbs results in an insulin spike, which will make you hungry.  This is compounded by the lack of protein. Protein acts as a natural appetite suppressant, and it is essential in the bodily function of gluconeogenesis, which ultimately sends messages to your brain that you've satisfied your appetite.    Another sticking point are the supplements. The recovery shake and protein bars are, quite frankly, not needed, and the same results can be achieved by eating the correct foods and taking a proper multi-vitamin. The recovery shake mix, protein bars and various other supplements recommended are manufactured and sold by Beach Body - the company behind P90X. Stopping short of drawing links, I think the implications are obvious. The alternatives to the shake and protein bars are not mentioned at all in the diet program; for anyone interested, the optimal post-workout meal consists of quick-release carbs and proteins. The protein bars can be simulated by eating foods containing a slow-digesting protein, such as cottage cheese, or a protein food mixed with fats (natural peanut butter or your yellow cheeses are best for this).    What's more, whilst the dietary aspect of P90X should be praised for recommending healthy foods, it's further marred by the simplicity of the portioning. Listing portions of foods and listing them as solely portions of a certain calorie group, whilst simplistic, also leads to errors. Most foods rarely are composed of simply one entire macronutrient (tuna, for example, or wheat), but alot more have a some other macronutrients (to clarify, those are protein, carbs and fats), and just as many more have a blend of macronutrients. By lumping them all into groups of solely carbs, or solely protein, users of the program run the risk of having their macronutrients balance wildly incorrect. Furthermore, dietary fibre isn't considered; a big no-no for any fat loss diet.    SUMMARY    This programs weights and diet sections are a mixed bag, and could be fixed relatively easy. The cardio section of the program is excellent and the saving grace, although it can be tedious; that's the nature of cardio, and indeed all fitness training, though. There's just enough in this program that's helpful that stops it from getting an abysmal rating; as stated at the beginning, however, there are better things out there.    3/5",

        "title": "P90x - How I loathe you",
        "body": "So, my wife and I decided to give this P90x thing a try. We finished day 3 yesterday. I think I can safely file this decision in the 'overly optimistic' category (like the time I said 'yes' to dodge ball with middle schoolers...but that's another story). Here's my brief synopsis of the experience thus far:    Day 1: We decided to start with the plyometrics disc. Tony (the leader-whom I have officially declared to be my arch-enemy) pointed out that one of the guys on the video had a prosthetic leg. Assumption: how hard could it be if a one legged man could do it? Stupid assumption. I collapsed around 40 minutes into it. I was no longer the boss of my own legs. I realize that the following sentence isn't exactly politically correct; but, I don't care. I hate that jolly one legged man.    Day 2: I decided to go with the 'chest and back' disc as my legs felt like jello and were barely functional. My wife was initially opposed to this disc because she wanted to avoid getting a muscled-up 'man back' (as she so eloquently put it). I assured her that this wouldn't happen to her...and warned her that it might not happen to me either. Apparently each workout includes a 'warm up'. This 'warm up' included things called jump-lunges. I hate Tony. As for the rest of the workout....I, again, ended up sprawled on the floor-like a dead man-after semi-completing countless push-ups. Pain. So much pain. Not only am I unable to walk like a normal human, I am now unable to lift my arms to floss my teeth.    Day 3: I sifted through the discs and found a disc titled 'Yoga'. YES. This one had to be easy. I knew a fat guy in college who took a yoga class to meet women (didn't work). Assumption: if he could do it, surely I could also. Horrible assumption. Apparently all yoga is not the same as P90x yoga. It's as if the P90x trainers thought to themselves: 'By now, the people who are stupid enough to do our program probably have ridiculously sore legs, arms, and shoulders. I wonder how we can intensify that pain until our participants cry.......OH, I KNOW! Let's make them do 90 minutes of yoga!' I did something called a 'downward dog' until my soul hurt. Realization 1: I am not flexible at all. AT ALL. Realization 2: Yoga is not what I thought it was (a style of peaceful, calming stretching and breathing). Yoga is not peaceful at all. Yoga is designed to punish you for not being flexible. I hate yoga. I hate Tony.    I'll admit, before beginning P90x, the thought crossed my mind: 'the wife might be impressed with my strength & athleticism'. Wrong. Unless, of course, shouting various insults at the tv whilst lying motionless on the floor is 'impressive'.    P3x down. P87x to go. Bring it on.",

        "body": "I'm only 3 weeks into the P90X program and I can already tell a difference in my body.  I'm an ok fit woman who runs regularly and has competed in several marathons and half marathons, but I recently hit a plateau that running alone couldn't fix (running alone wasn't giving me that toned look I want).  Since I've been doing the P90X workouts (I'm doing the Lean program), I feel stronger, leaner, and more confident.  I know that sounds like a cheesy commercial, but it's true!  For those of you thinking about buying this, the basics are that you work out for an hour to an hour and a half every day for 6 days a week, with one rest day.  Many people have posted that if you do ANY workout for that long 6 days a week, you'll get into shape.  I agree that's true - but I've done a lot of workout DVD's and this program is more fun and more challenging than many other DVD's out there (yet most beginners who are in average shape can do the workouts with the modifications in the beginning), so you'll see results.  Plus, with so many different DVD's, you won't get bored as fast (I get bored with workout DVD's really quickly!)  So, my summary is that, if you stick to the program and try your best, you will see a fitter, more confident you at the end of 90 days.  Will you look like the guy/girl on the box?  Probably not, but MUCH BETTER than when you started.",

It is VERY difficult, so if you are not in good shape, forget it.  This program focuses on core strength, felexibility, balance, and upper body strength, pretty much in that order.  I really love the Yoga X routine - I thought it would be easy - it is NOT!!  You will nor believe how hard you can work doing these movements.  Also, the Plyometrics program is fantastic, but REALLY hard.  I had to back off on that one a bit because of knee issues.Anyway, you can learn conditioning from P90X that you can use the rest of your life, even if you don't do the P90X routine more than once.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is pretty fit, looking for a change, and looking to improve their overall fitness.",

Two children down the road, I found myself struggling with weight and just feeling very out of shape.  One likes to think that chasing two youngsters around keeps you fit, but it just isn't enough for me.  Add to that the fact that I've stopped working for a while and the pounds added on and I felt myself becoming more and more lazy!    No more excuses here!  Once you start making the effort for this program, you find yourself watching what you eat because no one wants to work this hard only to waste the effort with empty calories!

        "body": "Just throwing my two cents into the ring.  I used to lift weights in my early 20s and then fell off the wagon.  Stayed relatively thin and kept some semblance of fitness in a labor intensive job but wasn't in shape.    My wife is a personal trainer and exercise videos and infomercials abound in our home, all promising the same things.  I just never got it.  However, I had begun a small workout routine using body weight exercises (didn't want to have to hit the gym again) of push-ups, pull-ups and an ab routine for several weeks and then I saw the infomercial for this.  I was captivated.  So we got it.    It will radically transform you if you 'bring it' as they repeat frequently.  It's a 90 day program, about an hour a day (an hour and a half for the yoga), six days a week.  It is time consuming and requires a commitment.  But if you do this for those 90 days, even just one cycle, you will transform not only your body but your overall level of fitness and your mental state will be greatly improved by pushing you beyond what you thought you could accomplish.      With a great mixture of muscle building, cardio endurance and functional fitness, this is really a well-rounded program.  I went through it once, did it loosely for several months and have jumped back in the ring for another round (P90X Plus is on the way).  I am a changed man.      At 40 years old, my cardio stamina, my muscular ability and my flexibility are even better than when I was in my 20s.  I could never touch my toes.  Ever.  Until now.  I used to get winded riding my bike up the block to get air in the tire.  Now I can ride around the city now barely breaking a sweat.  I may not be able to whip off 50 pull-ups but I'm over 10 and can do over 30 push-ups with ease.  Not bad for a guy who could barely do 2 pull-ups and 15 push-ups when starting.  You may not see me on the cover of some men's magazine but I can honestly say I am in the best shape of my life.      This seems to be in every one of thereviews.      Most of the muscle building workouts use your bodyweight - didn't realize there were so many varieties of push-ups and pull-ups - and the rest use dumbbells.  Each routine adds up to about 24 exercises in roughly 45 minutes along with about eight or nine minutes of stretching before and about three or four minutes of stretching after (which are a must).  Some routines are 12 exercises repeated twice, others are 24 individual exercises, all done in rapid succession which fatigues the muscles quickly and brings the results.    The other exercise days mix it up, giving your muscles a little relief but giving your cardio and flexibility a boost.  The Plyometric routine is brutal and will work your cardio system intensely but it will get you into shape if you push it.  I got through about twenty minutes of it the first time.  But then it was twenty-five, then thirty and finally I could finish.  Now I look forward to it.    Though the Yoga routine is comparatively long (an hour and a half) and requires focus to do, I fell in love with it.  It's not the stare at your navel kind of yoga.  This is intense.  Think you're strong?  Wait 'til you have to do a Warrior Three and a half-moon after having moved for forty-five minutes straight without stopping.  You will sweat hard even when it looks like you're not doing anything.  The added benefits are flexibility and a great sense of well-being when finished.    The Kenpo routine is a lot of fun and is probably the lightest routine of the bunch but a nice way to end the week.      In the 'rest' week in between Phases is added a Core Synergism routine which didn't feel very fluid at first but I've begun to see the point of it and have begun to notice strength in my core.  Also added is a Stretch routine which is a refreshing break.  A Cardio routine is optional which can be done in place of Plyo or can be used in addition to the regular routine to really kick up the game.  It takes elements of all the other workoutsjust listed above and really does a number on the cardio system.  There is enough here to mix and match and keep you fit evey beyond the initial 90 days.    Tony Horton is a jovial guy, kind of annoying at first and something of a show-off, but in time I found him to be very motivational.  He is 45 in this video and when you watch him rip off pull-ups like he is light as air and blasts out 20 push-ups with hands and feet leaving the ground, you'll be convinced.  He stumbles on occasion (struggles with balance postures) and botches up some phrases ('hit the bause putton') but this makes it more real.  He's a great coach and I know the scripts by heart which keeps it flowing.  Tony is the man.  'Do your best and forget the rest' is the mantra.      I cannot attest to the diet or the supplements and the equipment we use is a bar drilled into the rafters in my basements and a set of dumbbells.  No need to get all fancy.      It's hard, it's work, it's intense and it requires serious commitment.  But it's worth every penny and every minute.    P.S. Try Ab Ripper X without shoes first.  When you get good at it, add the shoes.",

        "title": "Good program, cardio is lacking if you're advanced",
        "body": "First, my background.  26 year-old male, 5'8' currently 150 pounds.  Did Insanity before P90X and lost 30 pounds in about three months.  Lost another 12 on P90X and built up some serious muscle and I'm only about 40 days into it.  I never had veins showing in my biceps before.  Have a four pack for the first time ever, but still can't get those lower two abs to ripple!  So, I've had some good success but I credit a ton of it to good nutrition (see next paragraph).    As with any workout program, results come mostly through good nutrition.  Think of a workout program as a supplement to good nutrition, not the other way around.  You will lose weight if you burn more calories than you consume.  You will gain weight if you burn less than you consume.  For gaining weight, if you eat clean and eat the right foods (fruits, vegetables, lean meat, eggs, nuts, whole grains, etc.), you should gain much more muscle than fat, if doing a good resistance training program.  If you eat burgers, tacos, and pizza every day, you'll gain some muscle, sure, but you'll also be quite flabby.  Don't expect to be able to eat like crap and do P90X and magically be strong and ripped in 90 days.  It won't happen with P90X and it won't happen with any routine.  But if you eat sensibly (I didn't even glance at the nutrition program) you'll get some great results.  Oh, and allow yourself a cheat meal or two each week.  In my 40+ pound weight loss over the last four or so months, I ate burgers and fries and/or pizza every weekend.  Sometimes I'd eat a Culver's triple and large fry on Saturday and a ton of pizza on Sunday.  But that was only two meals.  My other meals throughout those days were healthy.  And Monday through Friday, I absolutely did not eat 1 calorie of junk.  So, the point is, eat well 90% of the time and allow cheat meals to keep your sanity.  They'll also shock your metabolism into high gear, which is a good thing to bust through plateaus, whether they're strength or weight loss plateaus.    OK, enough rambling about nutrition.  The weight routines in P90X are pretty good.  Some of the moves are tough, and if you can't do them, simply modify them to moves you can do, or just do a different exercise.  For example, many people can't do pull-ups.  So grab a chair and push off with one foot (they briefly show you how to do this).  If you can't do one-armed push-ups, just do the regular version.  If you can't do regular push-ups, do them on your knees.  No big deal.  There are some exercises I don't like, such as scarecrows and pour flys for the shoulders, but I'd say that I really do like 90% of the resistance exercises in the program and I get a good burn from them.  So for building strength and definition, P90X has definitely worked for me so far.  However, for a bodybuilder looking to increase strength to bench 500 pounds or leg press 1,000, look elsewhere.  There aren't leg presses, heavy squats, or any bench presses in the program at all.  There are push-ups for the chest and mostly lunges for the legs.  But don't let this fool you.  There are various angles and varieties where you will get results and you will get a burn.  If you're an average person or even a fitnes enthusiast, you'll get the results you're looking for from the strength/resistance part of the program.    My main beef is with the cardio portion of the program.  Compared to Insanity, the cardio is a breeze, just plain boring, really.  If you've done Insanity and you're looking for cardio workouts just as hard, forget it.  They don't come close.  Still, for 90% of the population, I think the cardio in P90X will suffice.  Personally, I follow the strength/resistance workout schedule but on cardio days, I simply pop in an Insanity DVD and do that instead.  Works for me.      The Ab Ripper X workout is a terrific workout.  They say to do it after the resistance workouts but I do it on cardio days instead.  To each his own.  I really don't think it matters much.  It's about 16 minutes and believe me, your abs will be thanking you when the time is up.  It's a great core workout.        Lots of people complain about the DVDs not working.  I bought them directly from Beachbody and they all work fine.    Lots of people complain about Tony Horton being annoying or the cameras being shaky.  For crying out loud, people, you're not eating popcorn and having a beer while watching these!  You're working out!  Tony is not THAT annoying and I have no problem with the camera work whatsoever.      Be prepared to hear a lot about the Beachbody shakes, etc.  Just ignore it.  Of course they want you to buy their shakes, recovery drinks, etc.  It means more $$$ to them.  Just keep doing your workout and ignore it.      Overall, it's a very good program and the good far outweighs the bad.  For me, it worked.  I can't imagine it not working for anybody IF you eat right.",

        "body": "I purchased this P90x kit in December of 2014 as part of a new year's goal to get back some fitness that I lost following an arm injury in the fall of 2014. I've always been very active, but have never done any kind of home DVD exercise program.What you get : included with this order was the DVD set of 12 separate workouts, nutrition plan booklet, exercise program booklet, and tracking sheets and a calendar.The workout plan is outlined in detail in the exercise booklet, which I found to be very helpful. It includes several variations of workout cycles to choose from. This includes the standard P90x classic program, as well as a cardio-focused option, and a &#34;2 a day&#34; workout option. In the booklet is also included a written summary of each workout DVD, including a detailed description of each specific exercise, from the warm-up all the way through the cool-down. This was helpful to me, as I like to look ahead to see which exercises are upcoming over the course of the workout, and I would often work out in a room which was too noisy to hear the instructions that Tony Horton was giving during the session.Not included with this set are any actual pieces of exercise equipment. For me, this was not a big deal as I already had most of what I needed.Necessary equipment needed for this program: pull-up bar (doorway variety or free-standing), and several different weights of dumbbells (typically in 5 pound increments). You can easily substitute exercise bands for the dumbbells, as this could be a nice money-saving and space-saving option. I personally prefer the free weights, but my wife likes the bands for certain exercises.Additional optional equipment: push-up bars, push-up floor sliders. Push-up bars are helpful if you have wrist or hand problems that prevent you from doing a push-up with the palm flat on the floor. Bars are not absolutely necessary, in my opinion, as I personally prefer doing knuckle push-ups, but you can also just use the dumbbells as a push-up bar on the floor.As for the specific workouts, each of them has a specific focus and has its own strengths and weaknesses. I personally really liked all of the strength workouts. They are very simple, but effective. The plyometrics workout is also very good. I used to despise yoga, but really like this workout, and have seen some huge improvements in my flexibility since beginning. The kenpo workout is actually kind of fun as well. The only one I didn't really care for a whole lot was the cardio workout. I just felt like there are a number of other ways I can get a good cardio workout that were more effective than this one.As to the nutrition program, it seems like a pretty good system, but I admittedly didn't follow it beyond a week or two. The recipes that I tried were good and easy to make, but with young kids around who don't like those kinds of foods, it was tough having to basically prepare two meals every day. I personally chose to simply count calories via a separate smartphone app.I just finished the entire 13 week program this last week. I was pretty motivated, and only missed one or two days the entire time. I saw some huge improvements in my body composition as well as my overall fitness levels. I lost 16 pounds of body weight in the 13 weeks, which was close to my goal of 19-20 pounds. I saw my pull-ups go from a max of 3 to a max of 16. Push-ups went from a max of 35 to a max of 75. I also supplemented my P90x workouts with running and cycling several days per week and saw some good performance improvements in each of those sports as a result of my overall increase in strength.I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the workouts and with the system in general. So much so, that I re-started the program again last night, just 1 day after completing the original 13 weeks!",

These workouts are rough, even when I was in decent shape. I couldnt even imagine using these DVD's before when I was 240lbs. I'd probably puke or pass out about 5min in.That being said, if you're willing to make it work by going lighter, or working your way up to the level expected you can make it work for you.Just remember exercise alone won't do it, you'll need to fix what you're eating if you're over or under indulging. This is definitely recommended within the system, but you must make it work as a whole.Although fancy programs like this arent necessary if you can build your own program, I have given this to people I know who may benefit but don't have the ability to build their own plan (and I don't have the time to do so for them). I found this to be motivating for them, and a good all-in-one to get them to the next level.",

I have to say that the first week is the toughest to get through, especially the 2nd DVD where it has you jumping A LOT!  The workouts are about an hour long.  I had trouble with the jumping lunges in my first week and I almost gave up!  I however stuck to it and am pleased with my results so far, I have lost 10 pounds in the first month and am starting to see a little muscle coming in.  They nutrition guide and recipe book work and taste wonderful.  If you follow the nutrition guideline and do the workouts religiously with proper form, you will see results.  Tony is very good instructor in his videos and even has someone workout who has prosthetic leg on the 2nd DVD showing how people with leg problems can modify workout and see results.  For all people who say they don't have the time, do you have the time to watch 2 TV shows?  If you do then you have the time to do the workout.",

I spend at least an hour a day doing the workouts.  Plus it's holiday season, so I'm pretty sure everyone works/drinks/eats more around this time, so I haven't really been sticking with the diet, but I have been with the workouts.  Also, I'm not a cooker, and if you are single, buying all the food can get really expensive, so I mainly just try to make the right choices. Fortunately, with my body type, the diet hasn't been to detrimental to the process and as long as I am working out, usually I can eat whatever I want.  I have cut out eating out and try to eat at home for the most part except the weekends.  You will hear it from Tony though.  He is really funny and the workouts are awesome.  I am already starting to see a change.  You just have to be willing to commit.  Also, really focus on your form.  If you are new to a lot of these workouts, you really should do them in front of a mirror, I used to work out all the time, and I don't think Tony really explains form for beginners.  If you are new to working out, I could see where they would make a lot of mistakes.  So, really try to pay attention to what you are doing and what they are doing. It's really fun though, I recommend this product if you are willing to commit and do it.",

I found my self dizzy with a mighty case of vertigo after flailing for 30 minutes - at this point, you may want to make sure your neighbors know you have not taken up crack-cocaine or have come down with night terrors.Unfortunately, my brain could only handle so much crashing against my skull, and I stopped the DVDs after my fourth day. I happily went back to the gym. I am now currently in need of treatment for the voice in my head that keeps saying 'kick, uppercut, cross, hook'.",

I decided to start the program because I was looking for variety and a new challenge. I had been enjoying a lot of intense circuit training so this seemed to fit. I am very pleased.Anyone undertaking P90X should be aware that the workouts are not for cold beginners. Mr. Horton outlines a base level of ability needed to start the program safely and I agree with him. The workouts are intense, challenging and packed into mostly 60 min sessions (they include 10 minutes total of warm up and cool down) so, like any real exercise program, it requires a time commitment. Some of the exercises are advanced and Mr. Horton doesn't spend a lot of time coaching you through them. That would take up too much time. He notes what is advanced, what can be modified, and what could be skipped but that's it (that's why he recommends the base fitness/ability level prior to starting).  If an exercise is confusing, you can always watch a few before participating.I find most of the workouts to be challenging; some more than others. The beauty of the program is that you tailor it to your own goals. If something isn't challenging enough you step it up, use heavier weights, etc. If it's too much, slow down, skip, and rest as you need to. Mr. Horton is good about giving cues about when to rest and reassures viewers that it's OK to stop. The keys are quality and safety.Speaking of Mr. Horton; he's a goof ball. His style will annoy some and motivate others. I personally feel like his main goal is to just keep everyone moving. He doesn't take himself that seriously but let's face it, he's naturally intimidating (he looks better at 50 than most of us do at 24) so some people are just going to be turned off and accuse him of being a narcissist. Get past it, the results are worth it. I did not start this program to get ripped abs or bigger muscles. I started it because I wanted variety and to improve my overall fitness, balance and flexibility. After 3 weeks I was already noticing positive changes in every aspect of my fitness and appearance. More importantly, because of the program's emphasis on form and flexibility, I've noticed fewer aches and pains in familiar injury zones (shoulders, knees).I have to express the same criticism I've heard from others. The DVDs I received are not the highest quality and some skip on a cheap DVD player.o improve my overall fitness, balance and flexibility.

As of right now, I consider myself at an average fitness level and I could barely get through the first 2 days. Someone who can't do a pullup, pushup, or jump in place for 30 seconds should definitely consider a less intense exercise routine. I just got through my first week and I'm excited on getting through my next week to see how much I've improved or how much more I need to improve. Also looking forward to improving on my yoga because wow I was falling all over the place after my first yoga session. I didn't realize how much I needed to work on my balance.",

It's harder in the winter, I like to work out more, but you can only eat so much salad in the winter. The only thing is there seems to be a lot of standing around in between segments, I'm used to old school videos that don't stop for the whole hour, so don't know if I'm losing anything there.

        "body": "This workout program is no joke. If you want to get in shape, feel better about yourself, and make better lifestyle choices, give this progam a shot. If you find it hard to motivate yourself to even put the dvd in, don't bother wasting your money. I have found this to be a huge time commitment. I work full time and have a young dog with tons of energy. It isn't easy coming home from work and putting an hour plus long workout dvd in. Though I'm the type of person who can easily motivate myself which is why this program has worked so far for me.     You will be sore. There hasn't been one day during this program in which I have not felt some soreness. After the first 3 workout dvds, I could barely walk. The work outs are tough to get through, but the exercises are easy to follow.     The nutrition guide is handy and provides some great recipes and advice.     You should make sure to have different weights. For instance I have been using 20lbs, 15lbs, 10lbs, 5lbs, and even a medium band. I later purchased a chin-up bar which I never use, but the boy does. Everything else recommended would be nice to have if you were built out of money, but is really not necessary.     Overall, I have really enjoyed P90X. It isn't for the faint hearted. You should be at least familar with exercising and in decent shape. If you decide to purchase this program, I highly recommend getting a generic whey protein supplement. In addition, I've had to modify some of the workouts due to lower back problems. The key is to just keep moving, don't stop. Great product, tough yet fun workouts, great extras such as the nutrition guide and calendar.",

The diet guide is really good too, it provides ingredients and recipes which makes keeping up with the program really easy. The package comes with everything you need to start exercising right away which brings me to other thing that I love about this product, one barely needs any equipment, bands and a couple of weights, other than that with a little imagination you can work with stuff you find around any household. The only bad criticism I have is that the videos seem to be getting a little old by now but that is just me. I really really like this product definitely recommend it.",

        "body": "I have done this program and find it to be very advanced, but in general, this is not as difficult as the majority of Cathe Friedrich's videos. Of course, Cathe is a tough act to follow!    P90X is NOT the workout for a person at even a medium intensity level of fitness.     You must bet VERY fit to do this workout and even then you will likely struggle with some of the moves. I know that I did.    My favorite of the series is the 'Core Synergistics', followed by 'Yoga X' and 'Ab Ripper X'.    I use the Cardio X, Kenpo X and Plyometrics on easy workout days.  They are fun to do and basic. There is no complicated choreography, but Kenpo X must be done with precision to be truly effective.     I thought Yoga X would be easy -- WRONG! Tony brings it on in that video. He is in fantastic shape and has tremendous flexibility and his cast is remarkable.    Pros:    Tony is a great coach and a lot of fun.      I love his cast - they are such an inspiration. and they really work out hard and push themselves.      Many of his workouts are fresh and innovative.  He also puts a twist on classical resistance training and I like that.  I love the use of the tubing.  It is harder and more intense than I thought it would be.      While the tubing is really tough to use, it packs nicely for travel.  Try the tubing and if you practice good form, you will feel the burn.    Cons:    The supplements are a waste of money and I found the Millionaire's Club to be a money making scheme for Beach Body. This was a major turn off for me.  I want to get fit, not get involved in some scheme and contest to make money for Beachbody.    There are really only 12 workouts, so selling the program as a 13 disk set is deceiving.    I wish the producers had informed Tony that a camera is a mirror image, so his left is your right and vice-versa.  I find it to be annoying when he begins a routine and says begin on your right foot and his right is your left.    In closing if you are a very fit individual who wants to take your workouts to a new level, give P90X a try.    I am glad I did because I lost 10 lb during the first 3 weeks of the program.",

        "body": "The most important thing to say about this program is that it is a huge commitement!  It does work, however its difficult to do at 100% because of the time requirements and the diet program that comes with it.  I spent so much time cooking and working out, with a full time job, it was difficult.  I lasted a month at 100% before I had to slow it down. It is still possible, and I do recommend using this with other workouts as well.  Of course try the 90 days first!  However afterwards, its great to add on to other workout programs or make up your own, and alternate discs on what you want to workout and to keep you toned all the way around.  The workouts per day run from an hour to an hour and 30 minutes. Most workouts are an hour and about every other day you do abs with is 20 minutes.  Then the yoga x is an hour and 30 minutes.  I know some people don't like doing yoga but I love this yoga routine.  After getting used to Yoga X, I don't like yoga classes anymore unless its a hot yoga class because I feel like I get more out of yoga x than a normal yoga class.  My husband even likes yoga x.  Tony Horton makes the workouts funny and keeps it interesting.  I still laugh at some of his jokes after seeing the same one repeatedly. He is a great motivater, and I think that is necessary in keeping you engaged in the program and helping you to 'keep pressing play'.  I think if it were a more boring coach I'd have put the discs down and never played them again.  I've never been someone that enjoyed working out or that enjoyed sports.  That being said, I didn't have to use anything as a prep before doing p90x.  You may not be able to complete all the sets at first and you might take a bunch of water breaks, but with repetition you will get there and when you notice the changes it will motivate you even more to do the best you can.  I have acheived the best looking body I've ever had with p90x.  There are a few discs like the x stretch and the cardio x that you may not need, because its optional on your days off.  This is where you can implement something else like running (if you prefer that) or doing another cardio program, like in the brazil butt lift cardio, or 30 day shred by jillian.  Its important to remember to alternate between days so that you aren't working the same part of your body too much by doing it multiple days in a row.  Its like that with any exercise but especially with p90x because its so extreme.  The only thing I've decided to never do again with p90x is the diet program.  It requires so much protein, it was really hard to do.  However, more importantly, it does something to your body.  Even after I stopped doing p90x strenuously for over a year now (I actually quit for a time also to see if it would make a difference as well) and I now sweat profusely from my armpits all day long.  I'm a cold natured person and always have to carry a jacket with me everywhere, even if I'm freezing, my armpits sweat all day long.  I haven't been able to figure out a way to stop it and it ruins shirts.  Plus the wet shirts are embarrassing.  I've run into other p90x-ers locally and they've said the same things.  It isn't the same way for everybody, but unfortunately for me I'm one that it affected in this way.  My husband doesn't experience it but I do.  I don't mind sweating when I'm working out but sweating all the time is horrible.  The only thing I can contribute it to is the protein although I'm still not 100% sure why.  Just a warning.  The diet program consisted of a protein shake for bfast, a bar in the day, a high protein and some veggies for lunch, a protein shake after working out and high protein and veggies for dinner.  I might be missing a bar in there somewhere, I don't quit remember.  When I say high protein lunch and dinner, I mean like 2 chicken breast and veggies.  It was a ton of food.  It may be easier for someone that only likes meat, but I prefer equalammounts of meat to veggie ratio and it was a lot to eat every day.  I will also say that the packaging it came in was a little disapointing. It was a cardboard book basically and you have to slide the discs in and out of the cardboard every day, and it scratches the discs easily.  I ended up buying dvd cases and making my own DVD covers from pics online and throwing the cardboard flip book thing away.  After paying so much for a program, its a waste if you have to get them resurfaced all the time just because of the packaging.  Overall I do recommend p90x for anyone wanting to get fit.  Even as a supplement to other workouts, its great and you will notice results.  Extreme results if you can commit 100%.  Of the several beach body workouts I've tried, this one is my favorite and I believe you actually get your moneys worth out of it. Most things sold by beachbody are all the same price ($120) and most aren't worth it.  A little steep, but I actually think p90x is worth the money because even if you aren't doing the program, you can still use it every few days and get results.

        "body": "Tony Horton came off as the most obnoxious fitness trainer I've ever heard and at first it was hard to make it through the DVD's, and I struggled with my rating because of it. In the end though, I decided to give the product 5 stars because overall the product was tremendous! I thought if I gave it a three or four star rating it would discourage readers from buying the product based on aspects outside of the workout itself and that would've been a mistake. I say that with a caveat; you may need to turn the volume down and just follow the workout. P90X is one of the rare products advertised via infomercial that delivers what it promises. The product is handsomely packaged and not overly pretentious. Tony Horton leads all of the workouts along with people of varying body types, which is a courageous departure from the norm. However, be forewarned, this product is as advertised, 'For those who want to get in BETTER shape!' Do not kid yourself, if you haven't been working out you SHOULD NOT attempt this workout! The modules are strategically placed in a killer chronological sequence and produces results whether you're eating right or not; trust me. Having been in the military for several years, I wouldn't be surprised to see this product introduced to the special operations components of the Armed Forces as a compliment or supplement to the new Crossfit craze (crossfit.com) that's being fielded by the military and professional athletic organizations. You can take the workout just about anywhere and you don't need much equipment. You do however need some chutzpah because the PRO90X workout is a killer workout for those wanting to get to the next level of fitness.",

I didn't know if I could handle an extreme workout at this age, but decided to gamble on it and we both love it! The workouts are tough and take upwards of an hour and a half to do each day (when including the abs ripper every other day). I felt muscles ache that I hadn't used in years and was physically very tired during the first couple weeks but am feeling better every day. I'm currently in the middle of the third week and can see the effect, including the beginnings of a six-pack that I haven't seen well-defined in a couple decades. They are tough workouts, but I highly recommend them if you are up to a challenge.",

You go through a pre-test to measure yourself and take 'before' pictures of yourself.  Both will show you your progress.  Then it's time to get started.    The basic program is very rigorous.  It's a seven day per week program with each day's session taking me about an hour and a half.  You definitely want to be able to set aside and block the time necessary.  It took me longer to do the daily routines because I was not in as good of shape as I should have been.  I quickly saw improvement though,  as I stuck with the program.  The workouts go quickly, though, so I was never bored.  This is a great testimonial coming from me, the King of ADHD!  Bottom line: If I can stick with it and improve, pretty much anyone can.  I already eat a healthy diet, so I didn't do the P90X diet and I cannot comment on that.  I would recommend that you talk to your doctor before making drastic dietary changes, especially if you have diet-related disorders. Also, if you are really out of shape, the company has another program that will work you up to a fitness level to start P90X.    In sum, I highly recommend it.",

This program gives you a complete workout from head to toe.  If you follow it you will get results, but you will need to commit to at least 1.5 hrs per day/ 6 days a week.  The workouts have a lot of variety and are challenging so I have never felt bored.  I am half way through the 90 days and I can see and feel the results.  Even though the workouts are challenging, Tony Horton points out alternate techniques and advice on when to take extra breaks so that you can gradually work you way into completing the workouts.

Every body has a 'natural' max-range of growth - it is built into your specific DNA blue print.  Muscle confusion helps you achieve your max-potential in the most efficient way possible and gets you results fast.  Variety in the workouts.  Variety also plays a role in muscle confusion, but more importantly to me it keeps me from getting bored.  You will have an opportunity to try Yoga, Plyometrics, Kickboxing and Synergistics.  All of these activities, combined with the rudimentary workouts (pushups, pullups etc...) make for a fun and effective home workout routine.",

        "body": "Finally an exercise program that works and delivers result. P90X is comprised of 12 DVDs and these are it:DVD #1 - Chest & Back Chest This section is mostly about pushups and pull ups. I do the pushups the traditional way, and sometimes on my knees and also using the handles if you have wrist issues. For the pull-ups, I started using red bands but have moved to Purple ones as they provide a resistance of at least 20 pounds.DVD #2 - PlyometricsThis was the only workout that made me sweat a lot and I think it will make most of us too. It is a very intense and grueling workout consisting of jumping and squatting and is designed to make your heart and lungs work. This is a high impact workout but Tony teaches you how to do it correctly without the impact, the key in his words is to think like a cat, landing softly on your toes. You need a lot of room to do this work out as there is a fair amount of jumping around. I think this is the workout that will possibly give me most gains in stamina as a result of the intensity.DVD #3 - Shoulders & Arms This workout covers the biceps, the triceps and shoulders. These exercises work in two minute bursts for the targeted areas, the entire workout is about 5 3 set sections. This workout is intense and works the different muscle groups.DVD #4 - Yoga X is the longest workout in the series. It clocks at 90 minutes, at the beginning Tony tells us that we should forget all the things that have to be done in our life and focus on the workout to have a ride that we will never forget, and he is right.  I love this workout even though some poses are extremely hard for me such as the Crane, Plow and the Wheel. The first 45 minutes are poses which are vinyasas and are mostly sun salutations and warrior poses along with twists. The last 45 minutes are balance along with abdominal poses. This is a yoga workout which will make you sweat even in the dead of winter. One might think that 90 minutes is a pretty long time but times goes by quickly and you will feel refreshed. The music is superb and well suited to the entire duration.DVD # 5 - Legs & Back, this DVD works the legs and the back. I did not enjoy the leg portion of the workout but I liked the back portion a lot. A lot of pull ups with the resistance bands.DVD #6 - Kenpo XKenpoX Tony tells us that this is the most fun of all workouts. It is 45 minutes of kickboxing and throwing punches. I did not enjoy this workout one bit. I still do it but only half heartedly. a message board post at beach body suggests that 3 pound weights can add to the intensity. Still it could be a fun workout for many. However it is one of the easier in terms of intensity.DVD #7 - X Stretch Prior to working out, I used to think that stretching is a waste of time. Stretch proves to the contradictory, the majority of the workouts that ou do are variations of what you have done in Kenpo and Yoga but these are easier versions which do not make you feel spent. If the stretching in this exercise video is done correctly you can have more benefits and a calmer state of mind. One tends to rush through these routines because all the other exercises in other dvds are so intense. Don't miss doing this one as I know most people skip this one.DVD #8 - Core Synergistics works out your entire core so that it makes your entire body stronger. I hate working out the abs but this is fun. There are many exercises but you don't repeat any of them.DVD #9 - Chest, Shoulders & Triceps This is one of the most hardest workouts because you will be using the above mentioned muscles repeatedly.  The heaviest weight is not always desired because some of the movements are hard,so focus on quality over quantity. You will also be doing a lot of pushups, some of them with one hand. There are substitute moves with the resistance bands as well.DVD #10 - Back & Biceps: Works out the back and biceps. ALot of bicep moves with pullups and the lawnmower. Overall, a good workout which delivers results.DVD #11 - Cardio X is basically a combination workout between 4 other P90X workouts,  Core Synergistics, Kenpo X, Yoga X and Plyometrics. It ranges from easy to hard in parts.DVD #12 - Ab Ripper X This is the worst of all the workouts. It is extremely hard and at some point I could barely move but it works. I do this workout separately that is not immediately following a workout, as they recommend. I am too tired to go at it.P90X is by no means easy but a lot has been speculated by many people that the hard part is stressed to the point of over exaggerations. I am no jock, but these workouts are doable. I did the P90 to get ready for P90x, so there is a level of preparation which goes into this workout. Most workouts are long at about 60 minutes but I think they are of the right length because think of the time you would save on the These exercises have to be done 6 days a week, so the length and the frequency detracts most people from starting this program.This is not a program which will give you a lot of muscles but a program which will make you more fit and athletic. having said that, people have different bodies and commitments, so while it may not give everyone a ripped body like Tony. I think, it is safe to say, that almost all of them will experience a surge in energy, toning and gain in flexibility and stamina.Tony Horton is a superb coach; he is funny, motivating and full of pointers for making modifications.The exercise can done in three ways, classic, lean and doubles. The classic mode is fine for me, however I do aspire to eventually be able to do the doubles but time is always a factor for me.I have not followed the diet, had I done this I would have made more gains but its not possible for me to follow the Beach Body Diet. However, I saw gains through eating sensibly, cutting down on carbs, fats, eating more protein,less fat and sugar, something which we should be doing anyway.Tony hawks the recovery drinks a lot but I did not buy those those are expensive instead I drink a soy protein shake at the end of each workEquipment: Some basic equipment is needed but the program is about pull up bars ( I used resistance bands- red and purple) and push up bars ( I did not use any but if you have wrist problems you may want to ) The purple resistance bands give you a resistance of about 20 lbs.Yoga requires a mat and blocks if you have flexibility issues ( again I never used any of these)I used a pair of dumbbells of different weights.Enjoy....Lot of bicep moves with pullups and the lawnmower.

        "body": "I am writing this review to say 'Don't believe the hype' P90X is for everyone that is willing to put in the work, not only those that are fit & in shape before they start. I myself started out at 294, my highest weight EVER! and I took the pre-fitness test and barely passed it. I don't have diabetes, high blood pressure or anything else, just a victim of my own laziness and I finally got the jolt to do something about it. I am on day 8...I made it through my 1st week aching, but feeling rejuvenated and excited to do the workouts everyday. I chose to do the lean program as I'm looking for weight loss vs muscle mass. To date, I've lost 7 pounds! In less than 2 full weeks. I'm thankful to Tony Horton that he's created a program that's not boring and works every muscle you ever thought you had. I can already see the difference in my performance in week two as Ab Ripper X is no joke and I couldn't get my self off of the floor in the first week and now I'm up to 15 reps...by week 3 I hope to do the full 25! It's all about progression and lifestyle change.     Recommendations for those who choose this: EAT RIGHT! I tried to cheat and reverted back to my old ways for a day and I paid the price. Healthier diet is your friend with this because your body will speak back loudly about what you're putting in it! Get various weights. I'm a woman, and the 8lb are working so good so far, but I'm stepping up to 10 & 15 for more burn. Yoga Blocks are crucial. This was my 1st go round at yoga and trust me, the blocks are a blessing.     All in all, push yourself to succeed. Don't give up...I know that if I can do this, anyone can do it and I can't wait to see myself at the 90 day mark!",

I started this program and found that this truly was some no nonsense workouts that truly burn. However, to get the results described did not take the stated 90 days. For me, and i really committed and did not slack off at all, took about 120 days, a lot longer than they stated. I did some research on how it was taking so long for me and how other people could get the results faster. What i found was quite interesting. I found that p90x has some very great qualities about it, but their exercises are working your body the wrong way. I found a book that totally changed my world and the way that i looked at all of my workouts. These book, for all of 2.99 each, go into extreme detail on the way that the body actually works to build muscle and create definition. I really recommend that you read these books before you try any exercise program.[[ASIN:B00AEYR15Y How To Get The Six Pack Abs You Have Always Had: The Complete Guide Book To Exercises, Workouts, And Dieting For Men or Women (The Future U)]][[ASIN:B00AEYQVH8 How To Get That Ripped Chest And Back: The Complete Guide Book To Exercises, Workouts, And Proper Eating For The Fastest Results (The Future U)]][[ASIN:B00AEYQXMG Monster Arms Without The Monster Wait Time: The Complete Workout Guide Book To Huge Arms In The Fastest Time Possible (The Future U)]]",

        "title": "Yet another P90X success story....",
        "body": "I've worked out at least 5 days a week for the past 15 years, trying a variety of routines.  P90X is by far the best and most challenging routine I have ever attempted.  Anyone looking to burn excess fat and gain lean muscle need look no further -- it is all right here.My advice is to take your time the first few weeks.  P90X sells itself as a '90-day' program, but the uber-fit people you see in the infomercials have actually gone through the program a few times.  Myself, I've done the program once and though I've seen definite changes (especially in my arms, shoulders, and calves), I'm not at the 'Bruce Lee-fit' level of the program-graduates shown in those infomercials.  At least not yet!  I've now started the program again...and I can only say it continues to be challenging and rewarding.  So then this is a justified expense, as P90X isn't a one-time thing.Each of the main workouts is pretty hard.  I'd say the Week 1 'Chest and Back' workout is the toughest.  There is a lot of variety in each; it's a shame there's only one Leg workout...especially given that you do it every week of the program.  My only complaint is the cardio portion of P90X.  Simply put, I found none of them challenging.  Except for Plyometrics, of course!  That is by far the BEST cardio exercise ever.  Which just makes it all the more unfortunate that the others (ie CardioX, KenpoX) are so basic.  And, really, easy.  Even YogaX doesn't do much for me...and this program eats up enough of your time already.  Who has time for YogaX's 90-minute workout?  Instead of this and the other lackluster cardio routines, I did Billy Blanks's 'Taebo Get Ripped Advanced' (do NOT knock it until you've tried it...it's the only cardio workout that comes close to Plyometrics).Speaking of enthusiastic hosts, Tony Horton is a 'hoot,' as the natives say down here in Texas.  Personally I enjoy his constant dialog; it floors me that the man can rattle on WHILE he's performing such strenuous routines.  It does get a bit tricky, though; several times he's caused me to laugh while I'm doing an already-dangerous exercise.  Sometimes you have to tune him out or he might cause you to laugh, you might drop your weight, and great injury might ensue...  I also appreciate how completely obsessed he is with Dreya Webber (who appears in a few workouts with him, most notably the 'Legs & Back' routine); her husband actually produced the music for P90X, so it becomes a strange sort of love-triangle, with Dreya's husband doing the music, Dreya sucking up to Tony on-camera (watch how she only improves her form WHEN Tony's looking at her), and Tony basically fawning over her.So then, here you have a demanding but rewarding fitness program which will certainly give you results (there's no way you WON'T get results if you go through this program), plus it gives you some comedic value.  My only complaint, again, is the lack of good cardio programs...but since it DOES have Plyometrics I still say it's a solid 5 stars.does get a bit tricky, though; several times he's caused me to laugh while I'm doing an already-dangerous exercise.

        "title": "Helpful Information for the Prospective Buyer of a Certain Age and Body Type",
        "body": "It is a very peculiar feeling to provide personal information in a public review, but I think it will be very helpful to someone thinking about buying the P90X.      First, I am forty-three, and have engaged in no significant physical activity for a number of years.  I drank quite a lot until about four months ago, when I became a 'teetoaller.'  I smoke about a pack a day, Marlboros.  Since the first week of June, I have also been walking about 45 minutes a day.  Since giving up alcohol and walking, as well as watching my diet, giving up sodas, and not snacking between meals, I went from 220 to 200 pounds in about three months.  When I bought the P90X, however, I did not do my research well.  I was by no means ready for it.  This is a very, very intense workout series for someone who has been more or less physically active to a degree for some time. If, like me, you have been largely sedentary for a long period of time, not to mention less than kind to your body, this is not the workout for you - yet.  But, here is what is working for me, right now.      I bought the 'Ten Minute Trainer' through the same manufacturer.  These are thity minute workouts that I am using to 'recondition' myself, and it should take about nintety to one-hundred and eighty days, I am guessing, when I will be ready to tackle P90X, and with with no expectation I will be able to complete them on the first couple of go-rounds.  But, does this mean the P90X is sitting on the shelf?  No.  The P90X stretch DVD and the P90X yoga DVD are wonderful to start slowly unwinding those muscles I have not been using for many years.  And they are very challenging indeed, but not making me gasp and gulp for air.      When I attempted the P90X series, though, I noticed two things.  One, every part of me was sore.  So, I have no doubt this is a comprehensive body program.  Second, I did feel more energized.  I have very little doubt that this product works as advertised if used properly in conjunction with proper diet.      So, if you are athletic or semi-athletic and in reasonable shape or more advanced, I think you will really, really enjoy the challenge of the P90X.  If you are not in this group, like me, then what I would strongly urge before you spend the money is something like the 'Ten Minute Trainer' or low impact exercises over a period of time with a good, sensible diet to get back into some semblance of shape, and THEN try the P90X.  I am not looking at these purchases so much as a 'ninety day transformation' as opposed to a 'six month program.'  IGNORE the visual advertising, and just enjoy the challenge and feeling much, much better, mentally and physically.      If you buy this, however, also be aware that certain DVDs move very quickly through routines.  I found this extremely annoying at first.  But the simple way around this is to preview the DVD first and that will solve any problems in becoming familiar with the routines.  Some people also found Tony Horton's personal style off-putting, I know.  I do as well, but that's just because I tend to dislike people who are 'perky' or body-obssessed.  But the man plainly knows whereof he speaks when it comes to exercise and I adjusted to his gleefulness without much problem.  And, if you are really charged by people who are 'motivational' and relentlessly positive in their approach to exercise, you will love him.  But for heaven's sake, don't let trivial personal factors like that affect whether or not you should buy this product.          Highly recommended for the appropriate consumer.",

The muscle confusion concept is spot on.  The DVD rotation makes it so that you don't get bored.  I'm actually excited to go home everyday and work out.  It's the best part of my day.  Remember to go at your own pace though and for the first week I would not recommend using weights so that you can learn Tony's exercises and get your form down first.  I would also recommend having a recovery drink after you work out. I really needed it.  You want a 4:1 ratio and you can either order the P90X drink or buy one on your own.  I bought Endurox R4 at GNC.  It has the same ratio that the P90X drink does and it works great!  It will make a HUGE difference in how you feel after you've been Bringin' It hard for an hour.  You'll recover faster, you'll feel less sore and you'll have more post workout energy.      Buy it! Do it! Bring it!  You won't be sorry.......!",

Of course it would be better if they told you this before you purchase the product then lose money in shipping to and from.  It would also have been nice if I knew ahead of time that I needed a large area with all the moving around this course requires.  The area that I have to work out in is to small for all the exercises.  And most inmportantly, if you do return it, watch your bank statements!  I received the return authorization number and sent mine back.  Thankfully I had delivery confirmation on it.  Not only did I not get a refund, but the next month they charged me the second installment!  (Yes I bought this directly from the company.)  When I called to question this they needed to track the package to make sure they received it.  I then received the refunds that I was supposed to get, and quickly too.  But of course the refund did not cover shipping and handling either way.  And even with the 'free upgrade to express delivery' the S&H was over $21.",

        "body": "I think you\u2019ll like P90X, it seems like most people who do it find that they like it, and many even love it.This series covers pretty much any aspect that you want a fitness DVD to handle, each disc concentrating on one general area of fitness.  It\u2019s comprehensive, fun, and many parts are hard.Of course, like anything \u2013 it\u2019s how much effort you put into it.Tony Horton is a big part of what makes P90X fun, in fact you can\u2019t really think P90X without thinking \u2018Tony Horton\u2019 once you\u2019ve done the series a couple times.  He has a huge and amusing but instructive personality, as well as huge muscles (and on one DVD you\u2019ll see him propelling himself into a crazy and almost inhuman number of pullups).Tony will motivate you in a positive way without screaming, yelling, or other high pressure cajoling you like an old-school gym teacher might have done.Each DVD has a slightly different feel and \u2018personality\u2019 too, sometimes it depends on what the subject is and sometimes it seems like it might have to do with the people who are working out with Tony.  Each disc also has three other people (without the exception of Yoga X which has four people in addition to Tony Horton) who are doing the actual full workouts, usually P90X grads or trainers.  There\u2019s usually a modifier too who will show you easier or beginner ways to do the various things on each DVD.This series is plenty polished, with a nice gym-style set, and things move quickly as needed with most of the camera angles from the front or side so you can see Tony and his peeps (as he says).For the most part people do things correctly throughout P90X, sometimes with Tony\u2018s instruction and correction, unlike some other DVD\u2019s you may run across, sometimes where even the trainer does the moves incorrectly.There are a few exceptions once in a while that aren\u2019t related to the modifications.  Phil sometimes holds his breath during \u2018Chest, Shoulders & Triceps\u2019 \u2013 and continuing to breath through each exercise is something that Tony makes sure to drill into you often.  And Wesley\u2019s (who supposedly introduced Tony Horton to Kenpo) sometimes bad form and laggy, sometimes lackadaisical performance during \u2018Kenpo X\u2018.Sure, it\u2019s got a few other problems \u2013 to some Tony\u2018s jokes and explanations may get repetitious.  My niece mutes the sound and listens to something else why she does them, but I don\u2019t mind and I prefer not to distract myself from the workout, and I believe it helps you to keep up the intensity and not let the attention wander when you\u2019re concentrating on what he is saying.But probably the most important thing that is a bit out-of-date is the static stretching warmups at the beginning of the routines.  Current sports medicine says that we really should be doing isometric or dynamic stretching instead of static stretching exercises before a workout, to help cut down on injuries and lessen negative impacts on performance.  You can find plenty of research on this (Remember, Google is your friend, or DuckDuckGo or whatever you use) like this New York Times article.  I don\u2019t blame BeachBody or Tony Horton or any of the others who helped create this series, as our knowledge concerning the positives of using dynamic stretching over static stretching is relatively new, and P90X is the elder series here (2003).And how many people like the long Yoga routine?  Yea, it\u2019s a bit long.  Where most of the DVD\u2019s in the P90X series are an hour long the Yoga is an hour and a half and for me there are some somewhat repetitious and boring vinyasas.  I in fact edited a custom version for myself that makes it come in at around an hour.But otherwise P90X is a great mixture of everything you need, there\u2019s a DVD that\u2019s going to cover everything from upper body and lower body weight training to jump training to cardioto stretching and yoga to the core.I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other nitpicks but many are just personal opinions.  I think you would find this a good series.You properly learn form and discipline, yet you are shown modifications if needed and also are encouraged to take breaks if you need to.  There's minimal equipment that you need to have outside of regular weight training items, like weights (of course), a pull-up bar or resistance bands, and many things you could do with just bodyweight.Is P90X for beginners?  I tend to think not so much, but I don\u2019t want to discourage anyone as you can do even the most extreme things in any of the workout DVD\u2019s if you do modifications and take breaks and do them at a less intense rate, but really to do it as it\u2019s intended you probably should be in fairly good shape.I want to mention here also, Power 90 is an earlier BeachBody DVD series than P90X, and Power 90 might be more suitable for people starting out and who aren\u2019t comfortable doing P90X yet.I really like P90X, despite it\u2019s somewhat out-of-date warmups.For those interested; I review P90X and other Beachbody DVD's on my blog at [...]rsonal opinions.

        "title": "p90x gets you into shape and gives results",
        "body": "I'm in week 6 of the p90x cycle and so far am very happy with the product and with the results that I've seen.  I'm somebody who was already in shape and decided to replace my previous gym routine with p90x.  I have a tall and skinny build (about 6'1, 175 lbs), and have been able to notice budding ab muscles along with some improvements in my chest and legs.  The workouts are hard, and the first time through each of them can be very frustrating, but if you stick with it you'll find that each time you do a routine, you get better at it.  I don't follow the diet plan, but I have been eating protein bars and have cut down on snack food since I began the program.  Here is my breakdown of each routine.    1) Chest and back: You do this routine on day 1 of weeks 1,2,3,9,11, and it is almost all pull-ups and push-ups.  When I began p90x, I could do about 1 to 2 pull-ups, and now I can do about 6 to 7 at a time, depending on the type (you use different grips for each exercise).  There are about 5 types of push-ups and pull-ups which you alternate between, and then the whole routine is repeated.  This is definitely one of the harder routines, and at the end you can barely lift your arms.  You need a pull-up bar for this routine.  I also use push-up bars which helps my wrists and improves my form.    2) Plyometrics: You do this routine on day 2 of weeks 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12.  This is the hardest of all of the routines, as you are constantly jumping and squatting.  There are 5 sets of exercises which each have three 30 second exercises followed by one 60 second (easier) exercise.  There is one additional sports set at the end which is easier than the other five.  This is definitely the most draining workout, and the first time through, I had to pause it multiple times.  Now, I can do it with almost no pauses, but it completely wipes me out by the end.  If you have hard floors like I do, I recommend a workout mat.  Mine slides around a bit, so I have to pin it under the couchin my apartment.    3) Arms and shoulders: You do this routine on day 3 of weeks 1,2,3,9,11.  This routine is mostly focused around lifting either weights or using resistance bands.  There is always one person in the video using bands, so you can use either and not worry about not knowing what to do.  I use resistance bands since they are less expensive.  During this routine, you do multiple sets of lifting exercises: biceps, followed by shoulders, followed by triceps.  While it is less grueling than days 1 and 2, it still makes your arms very tired by the end.    4) Yoga: You do this routine on day 4 of weeks 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12, and on days 1 and 6 of weeks 4,8,13. This workout is longer than any of the other workouts (about 90 minutes).  The first half of the workout is very intense and is mostly different 'warrior' poses.  Most of these poses involve being in a lunge stance for a few minutes at a time and really make you balance while working leg muscles.  This part of the routine is as hard as anything else you do in p90x.  The second half of the routine is much easier and you mostly do different balance postures and stretches.  I've been splitting this workout up and doing the second half after work, which I prefer doing so that I don't have to wake up as early.  Overall, this workout (especially the first half) is very difficult, and it takes work to master each pose.  You need a yoga mat for this one.    5) Legs and back: You do this routine on day 5 of weeks 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12.  It consists of sets of 2 leg exercises (squats or lunges) followed by one round of pull-ups.  The wall squats and one legged wall squats are the most difficult exercises and really make your legs burn.  Overall, it is not as intense on your legs as the plyometrics day, but it is still very difficult.  The people in the video hold weights during most of the leg exercises, but I don't own them, so I just do the exercises without them which is hard enough.  The pull-ups are similar to the ones from chest and back.    6) Kenpo: You do this routine on day 6 of weeks 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12 and day 3 of weeks 4,8,13.  This routine is a bit easier than the others, but still gives you a good workout.  You throw a lot of kicks and punches during a short period of time, without a lot of breaks.  It is good cardio and is the most fun routine to do.    7) Stretching: You do this routine on day 7 of every week, and also on day 4 of weeks 4,8,13.  During this routine you stretch out muscles of each part of the body.  Most of these exercises are from the warmups of other routines or are from the second half of the yoga routine.  It's important to give your body a rest and stretching can make you better at the other routines.  I try to do it each week and have only skipped it once so far.  I find this routine very relaxing.  This is also a good day to do the Cardio X routine as well since it is not very difficult, and I don't feel like I get enough cardio with only two days each week devoted to it.    8) Core: You do this routine during days 2 and 5 of weeks 4,8,13.  You do a hybrid of exercises which work different muscle groups.  Some of the exercises work abs, while there are also push-up exercises for your chest, and others for your legs and back.  While not as hard as some of the routines you do other weeks, this not an easy workout.    9) Chest, triceps, shoulders:  You do this routine during day 1 of weeks 5,6,7,10,12.  This is one of the hardest routines of the program, and after you finish, you will barely be able to move your arms.  The push-ups from this routine are much harder than the ones from other days, and some (such as one arm push-ups) are still too hard for me to do.  The triceps and shoulder exercises are similar to the ones you do during the other weeks, but doing them on the same day as the push-ups makes them much more difficult.    10) Biceps and back:  You do this routine during day 3 of weeks 5,6,7,10,12.  While this is not the hardest workout in the program, your arms will feel sore by the end, as you do a lot of bicep curls and pull-ups.  It is slightly shorter than the other routines, which makes it go by quickly.    11) Abs: You do this routine on days 1,3,5 of weeks 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12 at the end of the other routines each day.  The ab workout is maybe the best workout of the package and gives the most visible results.  It is 15 minutes long, and is hard work.  The first few times through, I couldn't get through the entire routine, and my abs hurt afterward, but I've improved since, and have noticed the most results from this workout.    12) Cardio X:  I did this workout a few times during the rest week (4,8,13).  It starts out with some of the 'warrior' yoga moves, followed by some kenpo, then some plyo, and finally some of the core exercises from other days.  This workout isn't to difficult and is a good supplement if you have some extra time to burn off additional calories, especially since you only do cardio twice a week usually.      Overall, I'm very happy with the program.  The dvd's are good quality (although they aren't wide-screen which is annoying since the black bars on the sides of the screen are becoming visible when I watch other things on TV).  I also like that during each workout there is a status bar at the bottom of the screen which tells you how much longer the workout is as well as how long you have left in the current exercise (although the status bar has also burned into my screen a little bit).  The casing that holds the DVDs is pretty bad, so you might want to put them in a jewel case instead so that they don't get scratched up, as I've seen a few people complaining about this in the comments.  Tony is a bit cheesy at times, but I don't mind that.  Some people complain that he talks too much between exercises, but he has to in order to give you enough time to rest between each exercise.  The only thing which I find annoying is that he advertises the recovery drink during each routine.  He's pretty good at describing the exercises, but the first time through, you might want to watch how to do some of them.  I was already going to a gym and running each day for a half an hour, so the time commitment isn't too much worse for me than before and I don't have to leave my apartment.  It is definitely for people who are already in shape, so I recommend if you haven't worked out in a while that you should probably ease into it with the cardio x, stretching, and kenpo routines before getting into the others.  As I said above, I don't do the diet plan, but I've made an effort to eat healthier foods and more protein, which I think is good enough.  I also end up getting drinks with friends each week, so I try to make up for it by either running a little extra on those days or doing Cardio X in addition to my other routine.  When I do go out, I also try to stay away from mixed drinks which contain a lot of sugar.  A few times I've been away for a weekend and had to skip a day, but I made up for it by pushing everything back and then doing stretching on the same day as Kenpo to catch up.  p90x is definitely a much more fun and more motivating way to work out, and if you work hard enough, you will get results.",

But don't skip the yoga entirely it is an important part of the system it's just too bad that Tony can't teach it properly.",

Many of the recipes are very involved.  For instance, there is a whole section on making your own sauces.I'm not a big foodie, and I don't particularly like cooking.  I would have been willing to follow simple recipes, but the book didn't fit my needs.",
