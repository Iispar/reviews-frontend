This means if you lift weights, the calorie readings will be off. As another reviewer put it, lifting weights does not cause your heart rate to climb very much so a heart rate monitor will not be able to track calories burned for those types of exercises. But I really enjoy its input for my cardio. Also, I'm one of those lazy people who needs a cool gadget to motivate me to work out and this has done beautifully! Plus, you don't have to look at the watch while your running, the device that you strap to your chest transmit the readings on the same frequency as the treadmill does. Thus, the treadmill picks up the signal and shows you what your heart rate is! It's handy!",

Because with working out, results are obviously not immediate, I mainly bought this monitor so I could see how many calories I was burning per workout. Seeing the calorie burn count go up has kept me motivated. I am able to see which workouts give me the most burn in the least amount of time. It stores up to 10 workouts so you can go back and see what you have burned. It is very easy to set up and operate. It is comfortable to wear and I honestly have no complaints.",

If I make it any tighter it will sit on the sensor and that's not supposed to be bent so probably not a good idea.

Trying to program it took some time, but I finally managed to get it all right.  I also had to figure out how to use it at the gym, but after a few button pushes I was able to figure that out also.  The tricky part was keeping it going as sometimes it would just stop showing results.  I tried to moisten the chest strap before using it which would help, but not all of the time.  When it worked, it worked well and would show calories burned, time worked out and heart rates.  During the work out I could keep track of my heart rate and would know if I needed to ramp it up or cut back a bit.  Usually I go to an indoor cycling class and it did a great job of showing me how my work out was going.  It was somewhat hard to replace the battery and sometimes I wasn't sure if the watch or the chest strap battery needed replacing.  Overall, I loved having my workout results on my watch so I knew how I was doing.",

I am a smaller athletic girl and was concerned that either the wrist, or the chest straps will be too big. However, both straps fit perfectly and there is room in both straps either way! Definitely no concerns about the fit, I can see it fitting women from size 00 up to 16. Not sure if it will comfortably fit the plus sized women, that is just something I cannot comment on. But is definitely great for smaller women and is comfortable too. The screen is very simple, but easy to navigate. It doesn't do anything fancy, but I mostly bought it to accurately track my heart rate and the calories burned, and it does that so I am pleased. I am looking out to try it out during my next work out, and I hope that it performs smoothly for a long time from now. P.S. The monitor can be also worn as a wrist watch/alarm outside of working out.",

The watch is plastic and a little bit bulky for everyday wear. It is waterproof,I wore it in the pool one day and didn't have any issues with it when I was swimming. The one problem I have had with it is that if you do a lot of twisting and turning of your torso(like a turbofire workout does) you tend to lose connection and the monitor does not pick up your heart rate properly. So I make sure to keep an eye on my Heart rate to make sure that it is transmitting properly. Set up is a breeze and the batteries seem to last a long time. I've had mine for 5 months and have used it almost daily and have yet to replace the battery. This is a great watch for the person looking to track heart rate for a true calorie burn total.",

        "body": "FREAKING LOVE THIS WATCH. I have never had any sort of fitness watch/step monitor/etc. type health tracker. Ever. The most I have ever done is track my calories in an app. This watch, makes me feel like I am conquering the world every time I am done with a work out. I know I push myself harder to see that calorie count go higher and higher. My first work out with this watch, I burned almost 800 calories. I just couldn't stop. Now I average about 500 calories per work out. Its so nice to see that my weight training is burning so many calories! Go Polar! I love the price! Never ha an issue ever!!!!!",

When I first got it, I was having a problem with it say &#34;Check Heart Transmitter&#34;, however, I took the batteries out and put them in again, (without pushing it up in the backing, just laying it in loosely and then putting the back on it.) Since then, I haven't had any problems with it! I wear it usually 4 times a week for different activities. (Zumba, walking, running, softball...)",

        "body": "I purchased this item and it works fine, it does its job, gives you the basic data that you may need and it is light.I dont have the habit of use a wrist clock, so I use it only while my workouts. Sometimes they are not as often as I would wish. With this said, I dont need the monitor to be ON always, so what I do is turn it off and then turn it on again when I want to use it. I was wondering how it was designed so that manufacturing had the oportunity to turn it off without taking off the battery. And I found it!!!!To do so you must have plenty of fingers and a little bit of patience... The main instruction would be, press all the buttons and wait for some time.But I have found that if you do it in certain order, it is easier to have success. So press the square button, without unpressing the button, press the down button, without unpressing previous buttons, press the circle button, without unpressing the previous buttons press the up button and finnally after pressing the 4 buttons and making sure the 4 buttons are pressed, press the light button and hold it for about 4 seconds. When the monitor has shut down, unhold the buttons and the monitor is turned off.Will you loose data... Yes and no. The data that is from your previous runs, will hold on the internal memory and they wont be erased by the action of turning off the product. BUT the date and time will be lost and also your preferences. Everything in this life has a cost. Your personal settings like your date of birth, weight and height, will not be changed but it has to be loaded. How to explain this... You have to update your weight, date of birth and height but it will appear as if the monitor would already know it...Well, I hope this review help you to turn off your device without a problem and I hope you can enjoy it more.",

        "body": "You can't beat the way polar stands behind their products.  I had a monitor before this one.  It was well out of warranty when the battery gave out.  The instructions very clearly said to only allow Polat to change the battery.  So I took it to Batteries RUS and had a new battery put in.  That lasted less that a week.  I sent the monitor to Polar with a full confession of what I had done.  In a very short time I received another monitor from Polar.  It may have been reconditioned I don't know.  But it functioned just fine for another few years.  Even though I told them I had not followed their recommendations and the monitor had been ruined because of that. Polar still replaced the out of warranty monitor free of charge.  I tell everyone that is interested this story.  If I ever want anything and Polar makes one that is what I will buy.  Customer service goes a long way as does word of mouth.  I'm glad I had this opportunity to tell this story to so many people.",

Unfortunately after trying for two days to get the sensor to catch my heart rate (yes, I doused in water and had it as tight as it would go) it would not pick up my heart rate for longer than a few seconds. I felt like the sensor was weak, it would only catch my heart rate when I would press it as hard as I could into my chest? My other polar I've had for 5 years (f6) started right away. I liked the old chest strap better than this one, but disappointing that I had to send it back. If you buy this, buy from Amazon. Amazon is the BEST about returns.",

The Chest strap is  adjustable and very comfortable. i forget it's there after a few minutes. It syncs with the cardio equipment at my gym so I don't always have to keep looking down at my watch. Overall, it's a little pricey for what it does, I'm sure you can find cheaper watches that do the same thing, but this is worth the extra money for the quality.

The machines at my gym are wireless and the device syncs with the machines, so my heart rate is right on the machine and I don't have to look at the watch. It beeps to tell you when you are over or under your heart range, which I absolutely love. I'm going to buy one for my mother-in-law.

The monitor is relatively easy to set up and use. I noticed that the value for calories burned recorded with this device is always a lot less (usually by half) than what the cardio machine (treadmill etc) says.. The heart rate (HR) measured is usually the same on both cardio machine and monitor watch. I guess this could mean that it is true that the machines overestimate calorie expenditure.. but I digress.The only issue I have with this monitor is the strap. It has always been too big (no, it wasn't stretched) even when it is on the smallest size and it slides down sometimes, which interrupts workouts (it interrupts calculation of calories burned and HR) and can be rather annoying.  Other than that I would recommend this product!",
