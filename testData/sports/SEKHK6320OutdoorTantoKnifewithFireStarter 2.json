        "body": "Well hopefully if youre interested in buying this knife you dont think it will be one of the best out there, because its not.  I mean the fact thats its Stainless steel and really low priced should have given that away.  BUT, if that doesnt bother you and you just want a very basic, thin knife, I recommend this one.For a CQC knife, its perfect for concealed carry (please make sure its legal in your state to do so, im not liable if you get arrested) due to its very thin design.  The handle is wrapped with only paracord, so theres no wooden or plastic handle to make things bulky.  You could slip it inside your waistband and no one would suspect a thing.  I also like the black finish and green cord color combination, but that just my opinion though I imagine a popular one :).The paracord is not very good quality.  It works as a handle wrapping, but if you want a stronger cord or something that looks nicer, go buy it separately.  I probably wont replace it because it just wont be worth the extra money to me.  The cord is also really long.  It extends well past the handle, but you can make it shorter by tying knots into it.  The wrapping is fairly good, but a little too loose.  It looks like they could have fit another section or two since im able to slide it around a bit.  If you dont mind re-wrapping it, it shouldnt be a problem for you.I wish that the knife came much sharper than it did.  Really, this thing cant even cut paper.  You know how some sword or knife owners hold a piece of paper in front of them and then just slice diagonally across the paper?  Yeah, I tried that with this knife and it didnt work.  Just crumpled up the paper.  The good news is, blades can be sharpened and so can this one.  However, arriving to me dull certainly isnt going to earn it more stars.  At least the point is still...pointy.I dont know how good the durability and edge retention is and I dont feel like destruction testing it.  Its 440 stainless steel, so I cant imagine this knife would be any different in that regard from any other knife of its size thats also 440 stainless.  Im a sword guy, so I dont know much about stainless steel knives and how they are tempered or whatever...if at all.  Ive heard 440, while isnt the best stainless steel, isnt the worst so that should give you an idea on its durability and edge retention.  Again, I dont know how it was heat treated or tempered.  The black finish would probably start to scratch and come off with use, unfortunately.The magnesium striker works pretty well.  You kind of have to both hit and slide the blade on the striker to get it to spark.  Youll figure it out.  I was looking at it and I saw little dots in my vision for a couple seconds.  I havent tested it for making a fire yet, but ill come back with those details later.As for the nylon sheath?  It does have a belt strap.  At first I didnt notice it, but I eventually found a loop to slide my belt through.  The tip can actually easily poke right through it.  I may just try to reinforce the bottom somehow to prevent the tip from poking through.  Other than that, it works well.  Theres a little pocket to fit the fire starter too.Blade:  3'Finger Groove:  1 1/2'Handle:  2 1/2'Total Grip Length:  4'Thickness:  3/16'Overall, why would I rate this knife at only 4 stars and enjoy it so much despite all the cons?  I dont know, maybe its the shape and size.  I mean I didnt expect much from the start.  Now if I payed much more for this knife, id be pretty disappointed.  But I didnt.  I wish that the blade was about an inch longer, but whatever.  So on that note, I recommend this knife.  Admittedly, I got interested in these types of knives after playing Metal Gear Solid 3.  Since I dont want to spend so much money on a Strider model HT or DB, this will have to do.  Actually, I think this knife is almost exactly the same in terms of shape toa Strider DB.  Interesting.  The CQC knife that Snake uses in Metal Gear Solid 3 is much closer to the Strider HT.By the way, the box it came in is extremely simple.  All white, a picture of the knife and striker, and 'HUNTING KNIFE' in bold letters written on every side.  Inside, all it comes with is the knife, sheath, and stiker.  Thats it.  No bubble wrap or piece of paper.  I know its just the box, but I thought you should know.a Strider DB.  Interesting.

The &#34;para cord&#34; on the handle of the knife is crap, get rid of it and wrap it in some real paracord, or leather or duct tape, whatever you want. The knife itself is OK, in that it is a full tang  so no cheap plastic handle, but I'm not sure of the quality of the metal. It can be sharpened to a decent edge, but I'm not sure how well it will hold it. The fire starter works, but mine does not stay in it's little handle, I need to put a dab of super glue to hold it in there. The sheath is also crap.All that said, it's only 7 bucks, and really it's worth it for that.",

Best way to describe it.The magnesium stick works great. Just remember to angle ur knife (Sharp side) to a 45 degree to get the best results.

The fire starter is nice(wouldn't rely on it) but doesn't sit very secure in the sheath, and speaking of the sheath it's not bad but chances are if its on your belt or other exposed area on a hard haul the blade will fall out due to the cheap Velcro fastenings.",

Yes, the cord is less than desired and the blade is duller than an soup spoon but both of these are easy fixes. Now it's re-wrapped with 550 para cord and sharpened. It's a full tang  of good weight and size for my small hand.The sheath is horrible! and the flimsy Velcro strap doesn't stay latched but I knew what to expect beforehand and I got exactly what I expected.",

I was positive the sharpening session had taken care of my issue with the dull blade. Unfortunately, after cutting about three yards of heavy duty landscape fabric, the blade went dull again. I surmised the metal must be crappy. If you really expect to be trapped in the woods and depend on this knife for survival, don't buy it. You will probably die. If you just want a menacing looking weapon that will frighten old ladies at the grocery store and make you look tough, buy two! The knife does look pretty cool. The price was really cheap so overall I'm not complaining too much but it is an inferior product.",

I see a lot of reviews bashing this product because it is not a 80 dollar K-BAR. You spent five bucks, what did you expect. For the purpose of a beat around knife I keep in my truck and do not mind damaging using as a hammer or pry-bar when need be, it fits the bill. It is one piece of steel so it is relatively strong.

        "title": "Awesome value survival knife!",
        "body": "People say don't skimp on survival equipment but this cheap knife can definitely get the job done! First off, yes the blade is made in China. Now, the blade is only about 3 inches and is very light and easy to wield. The tip is EXTREMELY sharp and will do damage to you, your clothes and even the sheath if you aren't paying attention. It is a great knife for small work cutting rope or preparing food etc. This is NOT AN AXE! I guess in a pinch it could be used okay as self defense. The paracord wrap is alright but is easily removable and can be done in your own way if you wish. The blade sharpens well and holds an edge pretty good for a cheap knife. The fire starter takes a second to work at first when you're removing the black coating on it. Once you get passed that it sparks flames and starts fires like a pro. Don't try this in your house. The sparks are extremely hot and will burn everything they touch. The sheath that came with the knife leaves more to be desired and is green. It is cheap looking and feeling. It has two pouches each for the stick and the knife itself and THERE IS A BELT LOOP. The entire thing, sheath and all, is super light and easy to conceal. Honestly, to not buy this knife if you're a camper, survivalist or whatever then that's a mistake that you're making. It's cheap ($6.19 at time of purchase) and does multiple jobs very well. You cannot go wrong.",

        "body": "If it didn't come with a piece of flint, it wouldn't be worth the price, but it did, so it is. It's a low quality knife that comes SUPER DULL.If you're looking for a cheap mini backup knife for your Bug Out Bag, then this is actually for you.Keep in mind that you have to sharpen it though. I've done a bit of sharpening and mine is still pretty dull.This is one of those knives that you won't care about and use on things that would ruin a good knife.You could easily dedicate this as a flint striker that can sometimes be used as a 2nd rate knife, which is why I have one for my B.O.B. and eventually decided to get another one for my truck as a small, cheap, it's far better to have this than nothing, kind of knife.Unless if you're Rambo, this isn't even a decent weapon. I wouldn't want to get stabbed with it, but it's not something I would use to hunt an animal or defend myself with. But as a flint striker with some level of utility, it's ok.The wrist lanyard is some cheap cord, so if you replaced it with some length of 550 paracord, that'd be a decent place to have some.One one (not both) of this kind of knife that i ordered, the holster had the velcro's stitching go through both pieces of the belt loop part of the holster, so if you want to wear it on your belt, you may need to either sacrifice the velcro part that keeps the knife in place or restitch it. Or you could get one that's made correctly.",

However, with a bit of elbow grease I was able to put an edge in it, and I rewrapped the handle with paracord. I also replaced the yarn on the ferro rod with para cord. You will also need to take some med grit sand paper to the rod to get the finnish off l, and take it to a small spot on the back of the knife where you will strike the rod. This knife makes a good addition to my small &#34;go bag&#34;. It's a cheap knife for those who can't afford expensive stuff just to store in a go bag.",

The blade is strong and holds an edge well. And the Flint is sturdy and throughs a nice shower of sparks.

It arrived quicker than shipping estimate, was well packed with my other items. It did need to be sharpened, but performed minor tasks very well on our weekend camping trip. I was asked about it from fellow campers, who were surpriced by the low price I paid for it. I fully intend on buying more for Christmas gifts for the guys in my family.",

The fire starter flint came out of the plastic handle the first time I used it - glad I didn't have to rely on that. The edges on the top, where you are supposed to strike the flint, are slightly rounded at the edges where the blade has been stamped out of sheet metal. They should have a clear, 90 degree edge to get a good strike. The 'tough nylon' wrapped around the handle is cheap nylon chord, this made it feel very slippery to the touch and I wouldn't bet my life on not slipping while holding it and slicing my hand open on the blade, again, not good in a survival situation. The knife was completely dull and the blade unevenly peened, so sharpening it would be difficult. The annoying thing is, this knife could have been perfect. At a few bucks more, if there was proper Para-chord around the handle, a solid flint (plastic handles aren't really necessary if the flint is large enough), and the blade was sharp I would happily have it in my survival kit now.",

        "body": "When I purchased my Bear Grylls paracord knife, my son saw it and wanted something similar.  I didn't want to shell out that much money again for a knife for my son, who is younger and has a habit of losing them.  I picked this knife up pretty cheap and it's okay for what it is.  Definitely worth the few bucks I spent and it made my son happy.  He liked that it comes with a fire starter as I have been teaching him to make fires with it in our firepit.Pros:Very solid and has a good heft for its size.Comes with a fire starter that works pretty well.Cons:It came very dull and I had to sharpen it quite a bit.Again, it's worth the few bucks it costs.",

I have not gotten around to re-edging it, perhaps that will help but it should be like razor from the factory and it's not.All in all its good for the money",
