        "body": "My dog is normally pretty finicky with his toys, either getting bored with them quickly or never playing with them at all. So far my dog has enjoyed this KONG Cozie as much as he does his Loofa Dog toy. Another good thing with this toy is that it appears very sturdy, my dog has a habit of ripping the ears and legs off of his toys and so far this one has stood up well.For the very low price here on Amazon I would definitely recommend this toy. My dog is 60 lbs and it's a fairly good size for him. The toy came with a couple treats in a sealed bag (that we just put in my dog's KONG rubber toy) so that's a definite plus!",

What I didn't like was the 14 inch black hair sewn into the seam of the toy that I assume is human.  I noted that the toy is manufactured in China and inspected in the U.S.  Well, I removed the hair and laundered the toy.  My dog is happy, but I will not purchase from Kong again.Super fast shipping from Amazon.",

I'm sure if he wanted to he could. He's not careful with it, but not destructive. The outside is fairly sturdy, but how tough do you expect soft plush material to be really? This is NOT a tug-of-war toy, even if it has roping inside it.

Well, her &#34;Gator&#34; as well call it, has been her faithful buddy for eight months.  It's hers, and she's never destroyed it.  I think she remembers it being there with her in the crate when she spent her first night in a home (terrified), after leaving the shelter.  I don't know what happened recently, but she decided to rip out the stuffing!  The Gator remains though, in tact, with the exception of the hole that once kept Gator stuffed. I'm buying her a new one. She might destroy it, maybe she'll let it be a replacement, I don't know. Either way, Gator has a very special place in my heart and the heart of my Beagle.",
