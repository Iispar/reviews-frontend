        "body": "I have 4 dogs  - a 7lb Chihuahua, 25lb Corgi/Rat Terrier, 40lb Pitbull, and 75lb German Shephard. They have free access to the back yard, via a doggy door, and come in and out of the house as they please. They all love a good barking, especially when they're doing it together.  They're easily triggered -- basically, anytime a neighbor, dog, or child is outside, my dogs will kick off, racing the fence line, barking & growling for all they're worth. Unfortunately, I'm surrounded by neighbors, dogs, and children, and so the dogs' barking sessions are very frequent. Their joint vocal efforts are impressive, a mayhem of sharp, shocking yips and yaps, mingled with deep, rumbling growls, and sonorous, bass-tone woofs. Add me to the mix, shouting at the dogs to be quiet, and you can probably imagine the suffering of all who live within earshot of me, having to endure repeated barking/shouting cycles, over and over, all weekend long.I don't enjoy being a horrible neighbor, but I didn't know how to stop the aggressive, unwelcome barking. My dogs get lots of exercise & attention & are usually nice, social dogs -- I think the barking was just fun, pack-style. I wanted it to stop, but I didn't want to restrict their freedom by closing the doggy door, or hurt or frighten them by using bark collars. I tried silent sprays, which had no effect. A noisy spray, Stop That, had good reviews & did stop the barking, but it caused my Corgi to shake with fear for hours afterwards, and I threw it away. I considered the PetSafe Outdoor Ultrasonic Bark Control Deterrent many times, but was put off by the negative reviews. In the end, because I was desperate and couldn't find any good alternative, I bought it, and I am so glad I did, because I really think it's working! My yard is about 90 ft x 30 ft, so it sits on the ground, about midpoint. It's been about 3 weeks, and the dogs still bark, but much less frequently. When they start, I don't interfere, but just wait for the barking to peter out, which it does, fairly quickly. I have it on a low setting. The dogs don't seem afraid at all & don't even appear to notice it. They spend as much time as ever in the yard & on the deck. I also have cats who like to be in the back yard, and it doesn't bother them at all, either.So far so good!Ito peter out, which it does, fairly quickly. I have it on a low setting.

I would think the company would be able to figure out a way to have the batteries last longer than that. Initially, I thought the product was defective and sent a note to the company. PetSafe replied that depending on how much and often the dog barks and when you have it set to turn on/off determines battery life. Their suggestion: turn it off when not in use. REALLY? Just want it on while I am at work and they still do not last even a week. Disappointing, as the 1st couple days it works well.",

This dog is extremely high strung and literally screams at a VERY high pitch...constantly! Neighbors were beginning to complain, and I knew a visit from Animal Control was not far off. A friend told me about seeing your &#34;PetSafe Bark Deterrent&#34;, and being desperate (and sleep deprived) I ordered 2, as my property is large. What a difference it has made. He starts to &#34;wind up&#34;, and when he gets to a certain level he stops and calms down immediately. I have other dogs to and it keeps them in check as well. Thanks to this product, we are all sleeping thru the night and I'm no longer getting threatening comments from neighbors. Because of these cute little Bird Houses our ranch is tranquil once again, and &#34;Foley&#34; is alive and settling into his new home nicely!",

No matter how many times we asked them kindly do something about their dogs barking. WE could not even walk out in our backyard with all of them coming to fence and barking at us! Put this device next to the fence we share, on a shepherds hook. And, of course the dogs saw me they all came running up to me and started barking their heads off!! I turned it on...then the dogs backing away and barking lower! Then they ran to the very back of their property and stayed for the rest of the day!! Success after 3 years of torture from these dogs barking!! Will be buying a couple of more and put them all up and down the fence line!! Thanks PetSafe!",

She barked two times, then paused and barked once more for the first two nights, two barks the 3rd and 4th night and basically nothing after that. She barely goes out once or twice a week now and when she does go out she typically doesn't bark and she comes right back in. Amazing because she is hardwired (by breed...rat terrier and cattle dog mix) to bark at the opossums that walk along our fences at night. Every night she would get up multiple times to bark like crazy at the opossums. It was almost every hour. It was driving us nuts and we weren't getting good sleep. I highly recommend this item. For less than $50 bucks it's worth the gamble. I will actually take it with us when we travel with her to deter any barking.",

I tried a cheaper device and it didn't work or didn't have the range necessary, plus I could occasionally hear a sound emitting from it, which was worrisome. I could tell this one worked from day one, and I can always tell when the batteries need replacing because the barking begins again.

It kind of worked in that the yelpy mutt has stopped barking and yelping but the pit-bull cross seems to be able to bark through the pain. I swear, if you could translate it, the dog is shouting &#34;my ears hurt, my ears hurt&#34;.

There is no way it has a range of 50 ft. The sound may emit that far, but the sensor has about a 10 foot range, if that. On top of that, the dog will learn how quiet he can bark without setting off the sensor. I do love the way to program the time. Our battery lasts about a month, which is really nice.

She has some sepration anxiety and i caught her on video cam barking one night outside ,  i tried the citronella collar one day and observed for a few hours on camera before leaving her alone all night with it. It worked but would spray her even if she  scratched near it and she is very timid so dont want her being afraid all day while I am gone and getting sprayed.  Then ......to option 2 the ultrasonic device.  Well let me tell you ...... It works !  First bark outside and she came run ing in the doggie door like she just saw a ghost.  She tried barking again and same thing.  Aince then no more barking outside.  I did this while i was home as did not want her alone the firat time in case it scared her.  She is a Lhasa mix and very timid so if you have a timid dog , or a very sensitive dog like her this will work.  She used to go outside and join in the neighborhood barkfest , now she wants nothing to do with it.  Solved my problem and I feel much better that she is able to still bark in the house if she wants , I am just able to control where she barks with this device.  My sisters Shitzu was here and barked and it went off and it didnt even phase her, she just kinda went &#34; hmm whats that?&#34;  So it depends on your dogs personality Whethere this will deter him or her.  It definitely detered mine, although I did not like seeing her scared but at least I was here.  It has an on off switch so I only turn it on when I am at work as it can be pretty sensitive to things like motorcycles driving by and other noises.  My neighbors have barking dogs and it doesnt go off with them as there is a brick wall between.  I bought a wire  hanger stake thing to put in ground at the dollar store and it hangs on there well at perfect height.",

We had mentioned the barking to them and they didn't believe us!  Lucky for us this Bark Deterrent worked the day we hung it between the houses! Now if she hears us she will sit and watch,  of course we go and pet here. We ordered one for our daughter and they have 3 barking dogs next to them, worked the first time and they also didn't bark at the cat.I have also sent one to my sister who has 4 barking dogs next door to her I have no doubt it will work.",

The German Shepherd hates it, and has mostly stopped barking at the Mastiff, who is too stupid to pay much attention to the device. The shepherd is much quieter overall, so it really affects him. Taking that dog out of the fence war means the mastiff doesn't have anyone to get angry with, so she's much quieter as well. It's not 100% There is still an occasional skirmish, but I'm happy about the results so far.",

They barked so much that the 9 volt battery would only last about a week and a half. I decided to get a 9 volt battery elimator and run it on house electric in an effort to save batterys. It didn't stop the dogs from barking. Finally the PetSafe burned out! This was before the one year warranty expired. I called PetSafe and was told before I could return the unit I needed to replace the battery and conduct a test over the phone with the customer service rep. I reported to them that the green light was flashing coinstantly which showed a fault. &#34;Sorry you must conduct the twst first call us back when you are ready.&#34; At this point I concluded there is no customer service or replacement with this company.

One dog is 135 pounds and the other 25 pounds. Therefore, we have the full spectrum of bark levels (loud and deep as well as higher pitch barking). I hung one of these devices on our front gate and my big dog literally barked into it like a microphone. I could see the little indicator light turn on as the device registered the bark and emitted its tone. It did nothing to deter either one of my dogs from barking.I had high hopes and am now out of a big chunk of change. Save your money and put it toward dog training instead!",

I was worried that it wouldn't work based on all the prior reviews, but it does.  I ran a power cord out to the fence line and I wired up a 9v AC adapter to a battery connector so my unit never needs the battery changed.  I didn't even bother to hang it up.  its sitting on some bricks about face-level to the little dog.  I have it a foot or two back from the chainlink fence.Prior to setting it up, the little dog would bark non-stop all day and night whenever he was outside.  He prefers sitting close to my yard because he can see through it to bark at cars and joggers.  This means that I was able to set up the unit within feet of his favorite yipping perch.  Right away, I can see that he's associated the barking with the sound produced by the unit.  He'll let out an apprehensive bark now like he knows he's gonna get blasted with the high-pitched noise from this product.  And once he gets blasted, he shuts up.  I've got my fingers crossed that it continues to work this well.  If it doesn't then i'll try to come back and update this.",

Unfortunately, the item worked on the big dog next door who is a lab and our own dog who is a border collie, but did not seem to have any effect on the small chihuahua type dogs next door.  It would go off, and we could see it was working, but they paid no mind.

We tried this product after being cited by Animal Control with his barking. Once it was placed, which was about 10 ft. from where he was standing, he began to bark, the ultrasonic noise began, he just paused and continued barking. Absolutely zero effect...other than he noticed it.",
