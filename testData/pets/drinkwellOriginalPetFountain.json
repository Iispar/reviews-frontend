The motor isn't loud but the falling water definitely is; I had to move it to a different room because the constant sound was driving me crazy.  Probably not a problem if you like the constant sound of a water trickle as background noise.  It doesn't leak if you set it up right, and I haven't had any problems cleaning it yet.",

I find that this one gets moldy very quickly and doesn't stay clean enough for the cats to use. The filter gets very gunked up with slimy stuff and black stuff and the intake where the little motor is seems to hide and then spit out the same black particles. I'm not sure why. I wish this was better.",

After 26 days and two cleanings the pump seized the day I was going to do the third cleaning. :-(Fortunately, Amazon issued an instant refund and I purchased the Platinum model. That model has a pre filter on the pump.",

The bowl is about 6 inches in diameter and about 2 in deep. It holds about twice that total.",

In fact, it's really impossible to feel like you truly cleaned the whole thing because of all the little nooks and crannies.One lesson for you that I learned the hard way: Use the filters! They really do help keep it clean between washes. I originally thought I could do without the filters because I was using pre-filtered water. The water and dish were gunky in no time.",

This has not changed, however, the water level does go down, so I think he really does use it.  He expresses interest, but does not drink in front of me.  I definitely recommend this drinking fountain, but I think the reservoir is unnecessary unless you have multiple cats.

Very good product for the price. It is not loud at all, just a little hum of the motor. It does start to sputter if the water level gets too low, but that's pretty standard for any water/pump mechanism. I've had this for a month now and have attempted to clean it twice... and there's been nothing to clean! I was worried after reading the reviews that this would be a problem. There are a lot of pieces and crevices, but it's not been too difficult so far. My cat was drinking from it on day one. He has had some issues with his kidneys, so I'm hoping this encourages him to drink more water. Very happy with my choice of this fountain.",

        "body": "My three cats love to drink out of and play in the faucet water. I was tired of turning on the water for them at least 3 times a day and forgetting to turn it off before I went to bed.  Thus, I chose the drinkwell fountain because the cats could play in the running water like a faucet.  It is excellent so far (3 months). Here is my experience with some of the problems people claim to have with the fountain:  CLOGGING:  I was worried when I read that it clogs easily. Especially because I have two long haired Persians and one short haired tabby (all of which love to shed). Contrary to what I read, I have not experienced any clogs even with all of the long hair.  NOISEY:  Some people claim that the fountain is too noisy. When it is placed on carpet I can't even hear the motor. If you have wood floors just buy a little rug. In addition, you have to fill the water up fully BEFORE pluging in the machine.  The pump will be loud and noisy and not work right if there is not enough water in it. The motor noise is a good signal to let me know when the fountain needs more water.  It is extremely bad to let the motor/pump run with out sufficient water(can damage it).  HARD TO CLEAN:  Not really. Because it is a constant flow, the water doesn't stand still to become stale and therefore does not require much attention (I clean mine about ONCE A MONTH).  If you TAKE THE MOTOR OFF then you can run the entire unit IN THE DISHWASHER.  This makes cleaning effortless and gets those hard to reach places really well.  If I do need to get into the little crevasses, I can just use an old toothbrush.  Last but not least, I read somewhere that the fountain is actually HEALTHIER FOR YOUR CATS.  The constant flow keeps water fresh and not stale.  This helps oxygenate the water to improve your cats health which in turn MAY EXTEND THEIR LIVES.  P.S. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS that come with the fountain.  It explains, right there in black andwhite that you should place unit on carpet and fill water before pluging unit in which explains ALL noise complaints. ",

This Drinkwell did fine for her, no annoying splashing noises once you have adjusted the water flow to your liking, and less mess around the water bowl due to the wide design. However, when I got a second dog who was a 28lb I don't know what, I felt like I was constantly filling the container. Aside from filling it often the bigger inconvenience I realized was just turned into something else to clean. A regular dog dish can just be tossed in the sink and washed out. This thing is so big I had to take it to the bath tub to take apart and clean. You have to take the hole thing apart at least once every few weeks or it will start to grow bacteria like mold and such. There aren't several pieces but it is impossible to clean without the cleaning kit or some equivalent. After about a year I got tired of trucking this thing back and forth to clean it that it is now sitting in a closet and I am back to the plain ole' water dish. It worked great the motor was quiet, just be prepared to have to take it apart and clean it frequently.",

        "body": "My cat likes to drink from the bathroom faucet so I thought the fountain might be a good alternative. She used it on a daily basis for a few days but then she would only use it right after fresh water was placed into it. I checked the container after a few days and found that it felt slippery so I suspect that either the water did not remain 'fresh' because of some residue or she did not feel that the water was fresh or didn't like the taste. We gave it 2 months but it was simply too much trouble for how little she would use it. After the first cleaning which took awhile to figure out, it was pretty easy to clean and took only about 10 minutes to disassemble, clean and reassemble. It's a good alternative if your pet will drink out of it and you don't have to clean it every few days. It appears from the other reviews that most pets will use it. The cons are that unless you purchase the cleaning brushes it can be difficult to reach into the small places and, of course, there's the extra cost of purchasing filter on a regular basis. The hum from the fountain is unobtrusive in the kitchen. I suppose if the fountain was placed in a room where one wants quiet it might be annoying.",

        "body": "We've had our cat for a year and he's been very finicky about water.  He never liked to drink from his water bowl.  He'd always run into a room where he heard running water though and try and drink from it, even the toilet.  That was very bothersome and gross.    Now that we have this little fountain, he is drinking from it all of the time.  I think he must finally be getting some much needed water in his diet.  I'm sure it'll help keep him a healthy cat.  Our last cat died from kidney disease.  She never had the interest in running water, otherwise maybe we'd have put two and two together.  A product like this would have probably kept her from getting that disease.    So, when I got the fountain in the mail, I did as the instructions said and flushed it out several times to remove any of the loose charcoil.  Do it until the water is clear.  Then I set it up and tried it out.  It was very very loud, as in being in other rooms and hearing it loud.  And yes, I had the water well above the intake.  That scared me.  I thought I made a bad purchase, because this was literally straight out of the box.  Well, I did the only thing I could do.  I took it all apart (as intended).  Then I ran some water through all of those areas and I put it back together.  Come to find out, that did the trick.  It was then pretty quiet.  After you take it apart once or twice you see it's not difficult.  You'll want to do that at least every 2-3 days and wash all of those few little parts that fit together out.  If there's ever anything that gets in there, a little hair, or some food, then you'll have to clean it then.  It tends to make louder noise in those cases.    Our cat does love it.  He stands on the side of it, so he can drink the falling water, like he's drinking at a water fountain.  Lately we've even caught him once in a while just sitting stairing at it.  lol  This product may have added years to his life.    If I have one recommendation for the company that makes this, it would be to give it a detachable power cord.  That would help the cleaning process a lot.",

        "body": "PROS: Overall, we like the drinkwell fountain for our cats, and they like it too.  If we had a place to put another one, would even have a second fountain somewhere else in the apartment.CONS: Constant issues with the motor.  With the first fountain, the motor eventually broke and made a REALLY loud noise, so we bought an entire second fountain.  With this one, the motor seems to be slightly too large of a circumference for the hole it fits in, and is almost impossible to turn it and get it out.  We tried it in both the old fountain bowl and the new one and it is just not the correct size.  So now we have the choice of a loud motor or practically spraining a hand getting it in and out.It was already difficult in general to deal with the original motor with the way that there is only a tiny place to brace your hand when turning it, but this too-large-motor takes an extreme amount of elbow grease (difficult to do with nowhere to brace your hand without breaking the bowl).  Ordered a replacement motor from petsafe.com, but this is Drinkwell's last chance.  If this one doesn't work, I'm buying a completely different brand of fountain.  Lastly, a pain to take apart and clean all of the pieces, but as other reviewers have said, if you use filtered water (we always have), you can easily get away with cleaning only once a week, which is not bad.However, overall, the fountain works well (once the motor is in) and I think has encouraged the cats to drink more.  Would love to give 5 stars if the motor  wasn't always such an enormous problem.",

        "body": "Great fountain for the price - about 1/2 price of that in the big-brand pet stores.  Has adjustable water flow (great flow!) that can be turned up or down easily.  Simple to take apart to clean.  We have a lot of minerals in our water, so I clean it about once every 2-3 weeks.  While this would last with water in it for several weeks, I like to change out the water at least once a week to keep it fresh (although the charcoal filter does a good job of that).  I have one cat in our household, but I would imagine a home that had more pets might want to change it more frequently.After some months, sometimes I notice that fur (my cat has thick, long-hair) might get caught in the pump and it will slow down some, but with this new model, the fountain is easily dismantled to get to the pump (other models weren't so easy to get to it) and give it a good rinsing.  Quick to do: takes less than 2 minutes to remove top part, get at and take out pump, rinse it off, put the pump back in and replace the top.  Easy-peasy!The water flows fairly quietly, but there is a little bit of a soft fountain water noise - which I really like.  Sounds like a far-off stream, so it is a very pleasant sound.  I know my kitty likes this fountain, because not only does she have nice, clean water all the time, but she liked to drink from the faucets before (which I didn't really care for) and now with the fountain, she'll drink directly from the water coming out of the spout so she is happy.  :-)I have had this same brand before (but in a larger size reservoir), and liked it well enough that this is my 3rd purchase over the past many years.  I have tried other brands/types, but I like this one the best as there is no dripping or leaks (from the unit... when we had the dog, he would lap the water messily and drool/drip it all over the place - not due to any malfunction of the fountain though).This is a well-made and sturdy unit; if/when I ever need to replace it, I would get the same one again.  Very happy with the quality and materials.",

I had one I've been using for 4 years + and it is still working great, just some calcium build up that is very hard to clean so I thought I'd start fresh. I am not sure the one I received is not a counterfeit. There are none of the markings of Drinkwell that my previous one had. The whole thing seems a cheaper quality. I'm reading the reviews of others saying it leaks. I'm going to watch for that. I never had that problem with my old one but would not be surprised with this one. I'm thinking of going to PetSmart to check out the design of the ones they carry. Wish I had taken it out of the box and set it up when I first received it because I would be returning this.",

It does make a weird sound when the water level gets too low (this is why I gave 4/5 stars), but I try to add fresh water to it everyday. Of course the fountain is not totally silent but the noise is not enough to bug me, it's a quiet hum with the sound of running water.

For that kind of cat, I think this would be an excellent choice.  For our Fiona I think we'll have to stick to a boring water bowl.  I guess she doesn't look for adventure when she drinks ~ sigh ~",

The whole fountain is designed in a way that is very easy to keep clean. The large bowl allows for both of our cats to drink at once. Despite the large bowl, it doesn't take up much more room than their food dish... they've done a great job of designing upward rather than out. The filter is the easiest I've come across to change, as well. Just simply pull it out from the top and slide in a new one! I like the ability to adjust the flow. My only complaint is that it can be a bit loud. It gets a loud buzzing-type sound when the water gets to about halfway down the bowl. It's a great reminder that we need to refill, but it can be annoying when it starts in the middle of the night. ;) Overall, I would definitely recommend and would purchase from Drinkwell again.",

Cats don't like 'stale' water (as I was told by my vet). The fountain was noisy at first but once it started cycling it went quiet and the sound of the moving water was actually soothing. Then I got a dachshund. She drinks a lot because she plays a lot and when the bowl is only half full the fountain becomes noisy. I'm always pouring a cup of water back into it which I don't mind, I just hate how noisy it gets, you can hear it all over the house.  The reason I dislike it now is it is very hard to clean. The back part where the filter goes has a lot of tiny spaces and corners and my hand doesn't fit inside. I stick it in the dishwasher but there is still a slimy feel to the inside because it needs to be scrubbed. I bought little bottle brush scrubbers but those don't get the corners too well. This thing is just a pain to clean. I live in a place with very hard and mineral filled water. The plastic design for this is not a good idea. Once a week when I clean the whole thing I have to take a steak knife and scratch off all the white hard build up (and its hard to see because of the colour of the fountain, but I can feel it.)  Overall it's a nice little fountain, it just gets a little noisy when it needs to be refilled and is a pain to clean.",

I was very pleased at first, it didn't have the loud noise that some reviews mentioned, depending on the setting you put it on it was very silent or just had a water splashing sound (I always had it on que quietest setting). Once I set it up, my cat was more than excited. It did make him drink significantly more water and he stopped harrassing me everytime I walked into the bathroom (he likes flowing water). Anyway, about 3 months later the thing just stopped working all together. I called drinkwell and they sent me a replacement for the power supply, apparently it burnt out for no reason. Again it worked fine despite the corrosion from the water and the hair buildup that seems impossible to clean given all the straight edges that are not easily accessible. It's been about six months since I bought the fountain and now it just has tiny drips of water on the highest setting. It no longer atracts my cat to drink more water because the water is not streaming out of it and the plastic looks very bad despite my best efforts to keep it clean. I was hoping to buy something that would last me much longer than this, I am very disappointed.",

They wanted to sell me a new motor for $18.00.  But Drinkwell updated their product, and got smart and got a new motor design.  It is smaller, much easier to remove.  I mean the old motor was really a pain to remove.  This new motor is much smaller and they did some redesign how it screws into the unit.    So the old Drinkwell has been retired and I got this new one from Amazon at an Amazing price.  The new Drinkwell is running and I don't hear a thing.  Leo, my little buddy, checked out his new possession and gave me a thank you meow.  I have always loved the Drinkwell, I cannot give this a better recommendation, that I bought a new one, after so many years.  The best investment I could make for my little furry friend.",

I take it apart every 3-4 weeks to clean it thoroughly and replace the filter.  The ONLY problem I have with it - which resulted in 4 instead of 5 stars - is that the pump is very hard to remove for cleaning. And it DOES need to be cleaned. It necessarily attaches in a very tight, leakproof seal, but is situated in such a way as to make it very, very difficult to detach from its housing. If there was more space allowed to apply sufficient leverage to remove the pump more easily, I'd have given this fountain 5 stars. Btw: re-attaching the pump is no problem.",

        "body": "I bought one of these Drinkwells through Amazon. I got the optional resevoir and cleaning kit and with shipping it cost me $70. The Drinkwell has a relatively loud pump noise that comes from under the bowl part which spooked the cats the first few days (ands drives me nuts so I have to unplug it at night even though it's three rooms away from my bedroom). Once they got over the noise, the cats loved it so much that I would have liked a second (I have multiple food/water stations) but the price made that impossible.The other day I was at my local grocery store and they had a similar product called the Bubbler for $14.99. I couldn't believe it and snatched one up.Let me say, the Bubbler is not only considerably cheaper, but holds more water than the Drinkwell, is easier to clean than the Drinkwell and is quieter than the Drinkwell. I so regret spending that much money on the Drinkwell now.The Bubbler air pump is not in the bowl, it connects to it by a hose so the little bit of noise from it is far enough away as to not spook the cats. All you really hear from the Bubbler is the bubbling water which reminds me of those water fountains people put in their homes now.The Drinkwell pump is in the back of the bowl and it recirculates the water so you hear the pump itself and then the running water sound. As it pulls water from the bowl and recirculates it, any pet hair or dropped food that goes into the bowl gets pulled into the inlet and clogs it. Some hair goes right through these little pieces and then clogs the pump. I pulled a big hair clog out of the center of the pump already. Plus it uses filters so there's that extra cost. I have run it without the filters, so that is an option.There's only three pieces to clean in the Bubbler, the bowl and tank/lid, and they go in my dishwasher. The Drinkwell has 4 major pieces, 2 lids, three small pieces, and the pump itself which need to be cleaned with the brushes by hand.The Drinkwell is great and the cats do like it, and I would have gladly given it 5 stars prior to owning the Bubbler, but that would have been based soley on cats loving it and not because I had any true basis for comparison. Now I have two to compare and so my Drinkwell is no longer all that great. Even if they dropped the price in half, I'd still get another Bubbler just for the ease of cleaning and the water capacity it holds.brushes by hand.

In fact I have a cat that lies beside the fountain like he expects the water to start running anytime.  Now I could kick myself for throwing the old motor out (it was old and noisy, but still worked).  I would love to just replace the motor as I just started using the fountain a month ago. Found a site that sells the motor, but it is almost as much as buying an entire new fountain, so I am debating the purchase.",

Luckily, he's pretty good about drinking water so I am going to try to 'make it work' by running the motor and circulating the water primarily when he's outside. However, I'm sure I'll end up buying another one before too long, and I'll buy the petmate one I had before. It was impossible to clean but it was quiet.",

She sits next to it and wets her paws in the running water then licks them clean.  If the water entering the pump makes noise, unplug and plug it back in.  It may take several times, but once there is no cavitation, you should mainly hear the water hitting the diffuser.  One family member tried cleaning ours without asking how, or reading the instructions.  It was easy to order replacement parts, and get the fountain back in working order.

        "body": "When my daughter-in-law asked for this drinking fountain for their 2 yr. old male cat, I thought it was a gimmick.  But when we set it up on X-mas Eve, the cat was virtually at the water fountain every few seconds.  He absolutely loved it!!  We had put down a bowl of water for him when they first arrived, and the cat would have nothing to do with the 'well' water...tried to bury it a number of times, LOL!!  But not with the Drinkwell fountain.  The filtered water was fresh, and the motor ran quietly.  I also bought the reservoir so as not to have to fill it as often.  I see now that there is a cleaning kit to facilitate keeping the fountain pristeen.  I believe I'm going to order one of those, since the fountain is such a success!!!  If you have a cat(s), this is absolutely a must!!!  Thanks for stocking this excellent item.",

The only downside I have found is that the fountain is relatively loud, so you constantly hear water pouring. It's really not a big deal, but it may bother some people.",

I got it for my cat because I thought she would like the running water (she loved drinking out of the sink).After having it this long I'm not sure I would buy it again - partly because my cat's preferences have seemed to change and partly because of the hassle of cleaning and maintaining this fountain.I clean it fairly often but after this amount of time with it running constantly, the plastic has begun to feel rough and porous around the water line, making it harder to get the bacteria off. It is also not the easiest thing to clean and one specific frustration is trying to get the motor out of the back (it is really hard to twist out in the confined space especially with wet hands). Also I feel like the filters are made a weird shape specifically so you cannot buy a simple rectangle carbon filter. Also there is a fine line to this fountain between full and too low where the machine makes a horrible sound.I have seen other fountain designs and believe my cat may have liked a different flow pattern and probably a ceramic fountain better. At this point my cat rarely drinks out of the fountain, although she did drink from it in the beginning I wouldn't say she was overly hydrated because of it and still begged for other sources of water.Overall, I wish this fountain was lower maintenance (easier to clean) and that it held up longer for the price and the price of filters.",

I wasn't sure if I was going to ruin the parts or not by boiling them, but I ruined the lever that is used to adjust the flow of the fountain, so I ordered a new fountain. The new fountain is similar to my old one, but what didn't work for my cats, was that I couldn't lower the flow of the water enough for my cats. It almost seemed that the lever in this fountain did nothing if you turned it one way or the other and I think the water flowing too quickly scared my cats, I tried to get them used to the new fountain, but after a few days, I gave up and I'm using the old fountain that I sort of ruined, because with that one, the flow of the water is lower (and doesn't scare the cats). I didn't want to take chances thinking, if they get thirsty enough they'll drink from the new fountain, because one of my cats had bladder stones, which is why I had originally purchased a fountain in the first place.",

        "body": "Just received and setup the Drinkwell Fountain for our 8 month old cat.  She was giving us a hard time with insisting that she drink water from the bathroom sink.  I couldn't shave or brush my teeth in the morning without her instance to have fresh water water to drink even though her usual bowl is change many times through the day.  After several review from Amazon.com and PetCo we decided to give this unit a go and was pleasantly surprised how quickly our Libby took to it and started using it right away.  Her curiosity got the best of her as she was entertained by the running water from the spout. she started to drink from it right away and thus far her insistance to use the bathroom sink has subsided.I took the unit apart to check the hardware configuration (okay I'm a man with tools and I love to tinker and take things apart to understand how they work) and was pleasantly surprised that the same pump used for our 20 gallon fish tank is used in this fountain.  I figure that if the same pump that has been working great for the past three years trouble free, then we can expect the same with the fountain.  Good solid and simple design.Feedback from other reviewers stated that there was some pump noise that would disturb their cats, but with the unit I got it was pretty much quiet.  The trickling water made more noise then the pump.  The supplied filter looks to be better quality.  I did rinse the one that came with the unit with cold water for several minutes to rinse out any loose carbon or filter media.  It came out pretty clean from the start.Cleaning the bowl looks to be pretty simple since it come apart fairly easy.Time will tell how this unit keeps our cat happy.I'd buy another one without hesitation.",
