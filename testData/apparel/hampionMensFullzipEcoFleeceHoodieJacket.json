Very very roomy with long sleeves.  I did NOT wash it bec I didn't want to take a chance of it not shrinking enough, I returned it.  The fabric is a bit thin like other reviewers say, but not unusually so.  Besides the extra roominess, I like this jacket and style, espc. on the gray one, you have the black liner, it looks sharp.",

        "body": "I was prepared to be disappointed by this $22 item, ordering clothing on-line is always chancy.I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.Overall quality, feel, and appearance are good.  Would have liked it if it had a YKK zipper, since thats what seems to fail on my hoodies first, but you can't have everything for $22. Zipper seems adequate, but not very substantial.  Time will tell how well it holds up.Hood:One reviewer commented on the hood being too small. Guess it depends on body size vs. head size.  I'm a pretty large guy with a large head. Ordered 2XX and the hood is large enough to come down my eyebrows.Warmth:Seems a good compromise between heavy and light.  I bought it for wear during the fall/winter as my primary knock-about-the-house wear (along with the matching pants). Works well in that regard.Did take it out for a 1-mile walk in 50 degree weather and I was quite warm and comfortable.Have washed it one time and noticed no change in feel or appearance. Did add quite a bit to the link catcher, so I'd suggest washing by itself the first couple of times.I like it well enough I'm going to order another in a different color.Edit: I did get a second one, and overall ths same qaulity.  As I suspected, the zippers may become an issue.  On my first one the zipper was easy to use and smooth.  On the second one the zipper is hard to get started and not as smooth.",

The material is very comfortable on my skin and plenty warm enough.  The garment seems to be well made and I expect to have this for a long time to come. I really do think this is as good a value as you are going to find in the market today, brick and mortar or online.",

The white is nice and can tolerate quite a bit, but heavy sauce will seep between the weave. The fabric tends to whick away moisture, so when my sons sweat, the odor is not over powering. A light *hot water wash on *delicate is perfect. This is great .",

I'm a size 44 chest for coats and this size hoody was allowed the full range of motion to include crossing my arms without feeling any resistance from the back stitching.A very comfortable fleece hoody with nice styling and a price under $13 with free prime shipping. I'll purchase one or two more at this price point and even give them as gifts to family and friends.  You won't be disappointed.",
