But great jeans with boots!!!  As far as sizing is concerned, I normally wear a 31 waist for Levi's, but I'm a 32 in the 511's.  In my opinion, these jeans are great if your not 'thick'.  If your not slender, try the 508/521.  A little more thigh and crotch room while maintaining the slender look.",

I wouldn't recommend trying to judge what size you should order by the picture (who does that anyways?), but instead, go out and find a pair, try them on, find the right size, and then order them here in the style you want.  They don't vary too terribly from one style to another, so it's fairly safe to say that if one size fits you in one style, it should fit you in the other styles as well.    These are great jeans.  Comfortable and good-looking.  If you're not into wearing tighter-fitting jeans, go somewhere else - don't buy these and then complain that you ordered the wrong size because you based your order on a picture.",

But whatever, not many companies do anymore. All the money goes into the advertising budget to convince people to keep buying their shoddy products.My size 32x36 jeans turned out to actually be 31x34.5 - a complete joke. One size too tight and a size and a half too short. Way to go guys. Really, it's dumb of me to buy clothes online though, especially pants. But It's even dumber to buy Levis - any kind. They are a lost cause.",

The 511's usually sit low on your hips, they fit close to the body so that you get that nice thin look without squeezing your crotch into submission.  They look great cuffed.  They look great with boots.Hopefully my longtime experience can help others.  As stated by others, various styles fit different.  I've found that when I'm purchasing the rigid's I need to wear a 36W while I normally wear a 34W in all the other 511 denims.  For those of you who aren't familiar... the rigid is a stiffer denim that is nice and tough, think old school 80's Wranglers.Levi's is always releasing new 511 styles and colors and you really can't beat the price.  They make a good profit making a good product without gouging their customers pocket books to death.",

The stretch jeans will feel tight and true to size when you first try them on, but as you wear them they stretch out enough to add another size.  I have 36 waist 511 jeans which are 100% cotton and newer 34 waist 511 jeans with the stretch fabric and they fit almost exactly the same.  It's basically vanity sizing (making you feel good because you can go down a size).    Also, ordering a much longer inseam is cool with these jeans since you get a nice stacked look above your shoes.  You won't step on the back of your jeans unless you're wearing flip-flops.    Great pair of jeans for $35 range.  Fabric isn't all that but fit can't be beat.  Not just for skinny guys either.  I'm a big guy with big thighs (6'2', 205 lbs) and these jeans fit just right.  Big guys don't have to wear baggy jeans.    UPDATE 4/26/11:  The SAND DUNE color is listed on website as 98% cotton, 2% spandex. It's actually 54% cotton, 46% polyester in this color.  The fit is completely different than the same size in a different color with 98% cotton, 2% spandex.  Fabric is doesn't mold to your body at all.  If you order SAND DUNE you may need to go up a waist size.",

        "body": "I've always loved 511's, but these seemed a bit different than other's I've owned. The leg opening on these has moved up in size compared to old 511's. The cut has definitely changed and is a bit more &#34;slim&#34; rather than &#34;skinny&#34;. It was too large for my liking. I've got larger than average thighs, and the thigh fit super solid. Crotch is roomy and overall a great fit. It seems that the cut of the waist has changed...they're definitely a higher rise than my older 511's, but overall it's a nice look that I didn't have issue with. Also, no button down fly - bummer.The leg opening bugged me, so I ended up tapering the legs a little bit with my sewing machine. Really easy once you know what you're doing. I took the leg opening in about an inch, and now they're much more what I was looking for. I essentially sewed a new seam on the inside of each leg. I started down at the opening, and then worked my way up, tapering closer and closer to the original seam. The final stitch was about 3 inches above where my knee hit. You can't notice the modification, and it looks way more slick! After this small modification, I absolutely love these jeans. They look alright cuffed, no nice looking selvedge line or anything, but there's well constructed blue chain-stitching on the seam on the outside of the leg.The Clean Dark wash has more of a &#34;broken-in&#34; feel than other washes like the Rigid Dragon, but I think I'll still be able to get some fantastic fades out of these jeans. These are still just a 4/5 for me though - mainly due to the larger cut, and the lack of a button down fly.",

If you're scoping out what size to get, I'm about 5'11 and 177 lbs right now and i get a 36 x 32 in this style. The material in these jeans feels like they're already broken in a bit, so its a lot more comfortable to wear. Recommended!",

Easy now I'm mess'n with ya, and you know who you are.I have hated the cut of jeans since the early 90's. Sneakers with boot cut jeans make me literally cringe. There was a time where I would actually purchase a pair of Levi's at Sears or some place then go immediately to the tailor's shop and have them &#34;taken in&#34; below the knee. And of course they usually looked crappy but it was still a helluva lot better than wide calf jeans. But I digress.These jeans fit awesome, I dig 'em, and I plan on buying a few pairs - even a few a size up or so, so when I get older and fatter I still have great looking jeans! I still &#34;rock&#34; on stage sometimes and these jeans show off my &#34;gat&#34; very nicely and the bottom of my jeans don't look like freak'n bell bottoms.Burn all baggy jeans and score as many 511's as you can afford! Imagine if I was opinionated.Thank you that is all. Over......",

So if you are an adult I would suggest to go with a bigger size.

So a nice red cotton belt is in order.  The only down side is my own messiness, because they're white they get dirty very easily and ketchup stains are unforgiving!.

I wear a 34/32, and I have to say that's what they are, with maybe the length being 1/2 inch longer, which should work out great when washing (warm wash, half dry, then line dry the rest of the way to avoid shrinkage). I don't have a fat butt or thighs, and I'm on the slim side 5' 11' and 165 lbs. First slim pair that hasn't been a bit baggy in the butt and thighs, but another advantage here is the fabric has a little give to it, because of the 2% spandex (in some colors). Extremely comfortable for a skinny jean. The fabric is also a medium weight, not too heavy. I got my first pair in black, which can pass for dress pants with a blazer. I will be buying more of these, just a great jean -- Levi's best ever, as far as I'm concerned. Sure beats those $195 jeans that don't fit nearly as well!",

        "body": "If you're a skinny guy like me, go with these. I had always bought slim fit jeans that, according to description, fit just like the Levi 511 jeans. I loved them, so after a while I wondered, &#34;Well, what ARE Levi 511 jeans?&#34;BEFORE I decided to buy a pair online, I just so happened to hear an ad on the radio that Levi's 511 were on sale at J.C. Penny, I went in-store to try a pair on. I did this because when it comes to clothes, different brands size things differently. For example: You could wear a 32x34 for Dickies, but another brand's 32x34 may be too small or large. So I just had to check before I bought the wrong size online.These are great jeans for the guys that are skinny and don't want to wear baggy jeans, but at the same time don't want to look awkward in skinny jeans. These were, like, made for us.I wouldn't recommend getting the Express pair of 511's. They're cheaper than the rest, so I feel like the quality or perfection of them isn't as great as the others. I wouldn't chance it even though it's tempting.When washing these, always turn them inside-out. The color won't fade as easily compared to if you washed them outside-in. Wash them in cold water, and dry them on LOW heat. Anything hotter will cause them to shrink. If you're scared to dry them at all in fear that they'll shrink, then just air dry them.These are an overall great pair of jeans and I plan on buying a third pair in a couple of weeks. You'll probably never see me wearing any jeans besides Levi's ever again.",

I have tried on SO MANY different types of jeans over the years, and I always have a problem with jeans 'gapping out' in the back, revealing my underwear every time I am not standing up perfectly straight. (Sometimes even when I AM standing up perfectly staight.) I bought a pair of Levi's MEN's 511s a few years ago at a shop without realizing they were men's, and VOILA! they fit perfectly. No gap. This is literally the only pair of jeans I've ever worn that didn't have the gapping issue. They certainly fit me differently than they would (I imagine) fit a man's body, but I love them. I would upload a photo, but I don't see anywhere to do that . . .     I got a good 2-3 years' wear out of my other pair, and they unfortunately gathered a few rips (I was traveling and wearing them almost every day). Luckily, I found the exact same pair -- in the same color -- on Amazon. They arrived today (very promptly), and the color was a perfect match with the photo. Best. Jeans. Ever.",

What is so difficult about pre-washing and drying the material to prevent shrinkage after fabrication?  Isn't quality worth customer satisfaction?  Of note, as a woman I have not bought a pair of Levi's in years.  At 5'9', 135 lbs. and needing a 33' inseam, I cannot find a pair in stores or online that fits.  Plenty of shorts and mediums out there but forget finding talls.  When you do find the odd pair it is usually an odd style and only a 32' inseam anyway--shrinkage always a problem.",

        "title": "Quite a Fit",
        "body": "Pros: Available in many sizes and washes, reasonable price, comfortable and contoured fit  Cons: Not true to size    Having unusual proportions has always been problematic for me, and as a result, I have tried many different brands and styles of jeans. At 6'4', finding jeans that have a sufficient length provides some difficulty, and with a very narrow waist for my height (30'), it can seem downright impossible. I have no alternative to online retail for finding jeans that fit, so finding them feels very much like a hunt than a casual dressing room routine.    I have tried 7 For All Mankind, Chip & Pepper, Earnest Sewn, American Eagle, and a whole slew of brands to get a feel for what's out there. I never really considered trying Levi's because they just never seemed to draw my attention. I had no interest in Levi's 501's, because I knew they fit too loose, and simply was unaware that Levi's made slim jeans in my size, particularly the 511's in 32x36. Recently, I discovered this, and decided to give the Levi's 511's a try.    In my limited experience in the past, I knew typically Levi's run slightly long. Although a disadvantage to some, for a person of my height who never runs into a pair of jeans that's actually 'too long' (I actually fit a 37' inseam), having that extra inch or so is a blessing. Furthermore, as slim jeans, I presumed that they would fit slimmer in the waist than the size indicated. This may also serve as an issue for some, but considering they will stretch with use to your body, is worth accepting (not to mention it works to my favor with a smaller waist than the indicated size).    I ordered a couple pairs of Levi's 511 as a trial run and found my presumptions of running long and slim to hold true, which certainly brought me relief. While even a bit slim for me for the first day, they quickly contoured to my body and became quite comfortable. They fit well and have no extra baggage, as a slim pair of jeans should. While definitely slim, they areonly bordering skinny jeans. I find this advantageous, as truly skinny jeans tend to offer very little breathing room and limit heat dissipation. Furthermore, the tighter the fit, the more frequently you are inclined to wash, as the jeans become stretched out more quickly. I feel that the Levi's 511's fit comfortable and tight in the right places, and offer a perfect intermediate between straight/slim straight and the tighter skinny fits.    Currently, Levi's offers a host of different washes and in many sizes to find a friend in just about anyone who has the hankering to try some slim, but not quite skinny jeans. So far, I am enjoying my experience with the Levi's 511's, and I am sure I will enjoy them for many days coming. I really think you will too.",
