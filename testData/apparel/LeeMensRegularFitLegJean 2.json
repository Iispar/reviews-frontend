I have purchased a greenish, a taupe and this grey and those ALL run a touch smaller than the blue jean counterpart. Not much of a difference, but close to an inch or so in the waist. I call them my weight conscious jeans!! You cannot beat them for quality ..",

Lee is what I grew up with in the ranch country of North Dakota.  Everyone wore Lee.  I, at least, always wanted something else, but now I'm back to Lee.  These are the best.  The cut is perfect for me.  The size is exactly what I ordered.  The material is soft, flexible, not scratchy and appears to be durable.  The construction is tight.  I don't anticipate any seams breaking loose.  And the seams aren't where they  would trouble in a saddle. They are precisely what I remembered from 50 years ago, and I guess I'll stick with Lee from now on.",

You will not like trying to sit down or drive a car wearing these. Also, they run small, so order a size or two larger than you normally wear if you are going to purchase them. I put the pair I bought in the trash can at the end of the first day I wore them, as I don't like dealing with returns. As bad as Levi has gotten, I will have to stick with them, or start making my own pants out of old potato sacks. I will report back with a review of potato sack pants later.",

I will continue to buy Lee Jeans.  Go Buddy Lee!  UPDATE NOV 28, 2010:  Lee responded to my emails concerning the pair of jeans that fell apart.  I was able to exchange the jeans for a new pair.  Hopefully, this was an isolated problem.  ORIGINAL REVIEW NOV 14, 2010:  I used to always buy Levis. But I bought a few pairs of Lee jeans because of the lower price for occassional wear, mainly on the weekends.  I actually liked the way they fit and they looked good.  Unfortunately, Lee jeans lack the durability you would expect in a pair of traditional jeans.  After a few months of occassional wear, they start to rip.  I had one pair completely fall apart and rip across the front from the top of the zipper to the inseam.  They did not even make a ripping noise, they just came apart.",

        "body": "Ordered a pair to see how they fit because finding something around the 36'x36' mark usually isn't easy and most of the time even then the sizing is hit and miss, which can get expensive since I'm in New Zealand.Not only did these fit perfect they have lasted well and are very comfortable.  A couple of different pairs of jeans from other manufacturers I ordered were loose around the waist so these might be closer to a size smaller.  The fit and double black colour means they suit younger people too which is usually the hardest part of finding tall jeans.  I will definitely be ordering more of these.",

LOVE that I can get 29&#34; inseams. I bought a 2nd pair of these, after I tried the first pair I ordered, because I liked them so much. I think this Delta color is the more trendy color, which I wear out, when I want to appear to be trendy - I think it actually does. Other traditional blue denim color I where more for everyday. I cannot tell yet about how long they'll last since I wear my other brands, as well, and I hardly ever wear jeans in the summer.Straight leg profile is a little narrower than most others - definitely narrower than Levis (not as narrow as Carhardt regular fit/tapered jeans). I happen to like the profile; a little tapered would be more to my preference, but these are definitely OK as is. As far as fit goes, these are good for me, but if you're a big thigh guy, you should probably go with relaxed fit.",

The order came quickly, and what a thrill to find that these jeans were everything we could have asked for and more! The fit is perfect, and the colors are just right for my traditional man. I love the dark label on the back of the jeans. Tom is happy, and when we have need for new jeans once again, we will order these again. The moral of the story is: be open to try new things, and don't fret when you can't find your old fallback anymore, because there might be something even better out there!",

A little stiff, but fabric softener takes care of that.Bad: There may be some quality issues with the fabric. On one pair, the seat ripped after three months and maybe three washings. But amazon allowed an exchange despite being outside the 30 day return period. Color issues: &#34;Dune&#34; and &#34;Wheat&#34; are virtually indistinguishable. &#34;Black Quartz&#34; is more blue than black.",
