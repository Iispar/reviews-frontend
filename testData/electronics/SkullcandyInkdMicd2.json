I've owned several pairs of Skullcandy earbuds in the past before, but these are by far the WORST pair I have received. After only a month of use and utmost care, the right earbud stopped producing sound. However, I continued to use them because I didn't have a replacement pair at the time. A few days ago, the jack popped off of the cord, rendering them useless. I had to throw them away after only two months of having them. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing from Skullcandy EVER again. If you want good headphones, with spectacular quality - both musically and physically - bite the bullet and spend a little more cash on a pair of Sonys or Beats. Trust me, the extra money will pay off in the long run. And to be honest, you probably already spent enough money on buying several pairs of awful earbuds to pay for a better pair.",

        "body": "First off, as soon as I took these out of the package I was like 'Holy Mother of Baby Narwhals These Are SWEEEEEET!!!'They look absolutely stunning, especially with the flat cable.The quality of the plastic on the ear buds isn't quite as high quality as they look in the pictures here, but they are nonetheless very nice.Also, I ordered these with amazon Prime, which normally takes two to three days. A couple hours after I ordered I got an email saying they shipped and I should be getting them in one day at around 8 at night. I got them he next day at around 4 pm. SUCH a good feeling when that happens.So lets get to it, the Pros and ConsConsI haven't had time to see how reliable they are over time so I can't say anything to the build qualityThey only come with two different sizes of the rubber parts that actually go into your ear, so if you generally feel discomfort with these types of headphones that might not be too good.Extend use (say like 5 or 6 hours) will get your ears feeling kinda soar, but again, this might depend more on how your own ears areNo volume control on the headphonesProsTHEY LOOK FREAKING AMAZINGThe flat cable feels really nice and seems to be quite durable.They have a microphone attached, and you can click it to pause the music or skip ahead, or use Siri if you have an iphone.The cable is pretty long. long enough that i can comfortably use them wearing a long jacket with my ipod in my pants pocket and the cable going on the outside and under the bottom (this sentence is kinda confusing, but i'm too lazy to rewrite it, so basically cable is really long, but not too long)Sound quality is SUPERB. They can go really loud, they cancel outside sound quite well, and the bass is simply astonishing.When I say sound quality is good, I don't just mean good for 15 dollar headphones, I mean its nearly as good as the quality of my 75 over-the-ear studioheadphones.THEY COME WITH A GREAT BLOODY WARRANTY!I'm gonna buy another pair right now, and as soon as these break or I loose them I'm buying another 5 pairsI ABSOLUTELY could not be more pleased with these headphones.",

I liked the original &#34;rope&#34; style cords on the Paul Frank versions of the Ink'd earbuds and bought dozens of them, both as gifts and replacements for ones I'd lost. These are a shadow of those in almost every way.Pro:- Same sound quality of the original Ink'd- Has a mic- Price is still good, as alwaysCon:- The actual bud is re-shaped and is a little larger. This is bad because no matter what size rubber thingamajig you use, the size of the earbud prevents it from going deep enough into the ear to create a seal for passive noise blocking.- No tangle cord still tangles and is not as good as the rope style I mentioned before, though it is a marked improvement over the vanilla Ink'd cords that took the shape of their packaging and never got straightened out afterward.- Mic is alright, but the &#34;multi-function&#34; button is barely functional ... maybe it's just my older phone (original Droid Incredible), but I have no idea what the button is meant to do, unless it's meant to abruptly end all my calls when I press it.So, not a bad set of earbuds for the price, but when compared to the original Ink'd earbuds, this new and &#34;improved&#34; set doesn't hold up. Kind of a bummer since the company is good and it's going to be a while before there's another update to the model. I can only hope that Paul Frank or another designer will make custom versions of this new model later on down the line. In the meantime, though, just buy the originals and forget about mics.",

The &#34;skull&#34; on the back of each ear piece was small and not centered, or clear (again, compared with my older unit which looks great). I tried it on day one for less than a minute. The next day, trying it on, the plastic holding the right ear piece separated and was hanging by the exposed wires. I contacted Skullcandy, I was disappointed. With several emails back and forth, they first asked me for pictures. So I sent 5 (including the broken ear piece). Then they asked for the receipt, so I sent a picture of that. Then they asked me to cut the cord in two places and send more pictures back so they could decide what to do about a warranty. So I gave up. All I wanted to know is whether this is a fake product.",

        "title": "Great comfort and quality at a great price! I've stopped wasting my time and money buying MANY cheap earbuds throughout the year",
        "body": "With a young music loving son I have purchased more earbuds in the past year than I care to remember. We have cheap earbuds everywhere. The bargain basement priced ones seldom make it a week or two before the rubber tips fall off, the wires break or they get lost or destroyed.When we saw these on sale I picked up a pair. They cost a little more than the garbage that I had been previously buying but the additional expense is insignificant when I factor in how much better these are.I had heard good things about Skullcandy so I bought my son these exact earbuds hoping they'd be better than what I had been previously purchasing. They are! I've used them myself based on his recommendation.  They sound so much better and that's just the start.  They're also more comfortable and you can achieve a much better fit. These seem to block out exterior noise well and there have been no issues with the rubber tips falling off as is so common with every other set of earbuds we've had.These things have changed my approach to buying earbuds.  I had previously given up and simply treated earbuds as a disposable item since my son would sometimes go through a few pairs in a month.  Instead of deciding I'll just continually replace cheap $1-$5 earbuds 3 times a month I've decided I'll buy better ones less often like these Skullcandy Ink'd Earbuds.  As an added bonus my son actually likes these and is very careful not to misplace them or mistreat them as a result.PROS:+  Great value for the quality+  Good sound quality+  Durable+  Comfortable+  Block out exterior noise+  The rubber does NOT constantly fall off of theseCONS:- Slightly more expensive than other earbuds but you'll buy 3 to 4 pairs of those to one of these!",

Sadly, that wasn't the case. I placed a review not too long after I ordered about how great they were, but I kind of wish I had waited longer. Overall the sound quality is pretty good initially, especially for the price, but it didn't take too long before the first pair I opened started to get lower sound quality and eventually no sound all together in the left ear, then damage to the casing holding the ear buds together, then diminished quality in the right ear as well. I had hoped that the first pair was just bad luck on my part, but the second pair I opened STARTED with the left ear not getting any sound.I really hate leaving 1 star feedback so I guess I should leave the few pros...this product did ship quickly, and despite the problems with the sound from the ear buds the microphone continues to work flawlessly. Really sorry seller, but I will NOT be recommending this product :(",

If the images were clear I would probably not  have gotten these. Not to say these aren't a good product at all. I just look for a control feature like this when I don't have access to my phone.

I returned these and picked up the Sony MDREX15LP/B Earbuds instead. If you don't need a mic and are more concerned with media sound, save yourself the time and do the same!

The bass is definitely present but is really muddy. If played in full volume the bass will overpower the treble. The 3.5mm jack is gold plated.

        "body": "PROS-Best Quality Sound for the Price-Excellent Base-Nice Design-Excellent FitCONS-Didn\u2019t even last a month-Dead Earbuds are Useless EarbudsShould you buy it: NOActual Value: $2I\u2019ve had a couple of earbuds and usually I stop using them because I simply lose them. This is the first time that the earbuds have disintegrated in front of me. Although the sound is good for the price, unless are extremely careful with them (newborn baby careful), you\u2019re better off looking somewhere else.-Design-The design of these earbuds are nice and attractive. The flat cable design makes it hard for the cable to get untangled. The red on black color scheme looks good and the design of the earbuds themselves look profession and a level higher than what they cost. It comes with 3 ear tips which seem to fit in my ear (medium size). In design, Skullcandy takes the prize.-Performance-Audio quality is spot on. I\u2019m not an audiophile, but my ear is good enough to tell between a $5,$10,$25,$100, and $250 headphones. That being said, these aren\u2019t on the same level as Klipsch or Bose (Beats are a clear ripoff), but they are higher than what you expect. The bass is relatively strong and the tremble is okay. Clarity is good, although certain genres of music won\u2019t sound all that great (Anything that isn\u2019t Rock, Pop, Rap, or R&B). Still though, for the price, they can\u2019t be beat easily.-Quality-Here\u2019s where the real problem is. I usually take care of my headphones and I listen at a moderate volume across all types of genres (except metal). However, within 2 weeks the side without the microphone started to go faint until it was completely mute. The temporary solution was to just listen to the side with the microphone. However, one week later, they got caught along some plastic fence. Where most headphones would simply tug or slip off, this one decided to pull apart and rip off completely. That\u2019s when I went to the nearest store and bought a completely different set. These will not last as long as I hope. In regards to quality and durability, there are far better options out there.-Conclusion-If the headphones had stayed and lasted for at the very least 3 months, I would\u2019ve given them a higher rating. However, the quality of these things can\u2019t justify the performance and looks. It is similar to buying a sports car that you know it\u2019s unreliable. You\u2019ll enjoy the moment and regret nothing for buying them. But sooner or later, when you needed the most, it breaks down and leaves you to be on your own. That might be a bit exaggerated, but you get the point. There are options that come fairly close to performance, but won\u2019t break at the slightest sign of stress.I\u2019d recommend the Sony MDREX15AP. They aren\u2019t as good looking and look fairly generic. But the sound is more balanced than the Skullcandy and the durability is so much better. I\u2019ve had a black pair of them for more than 8 months and they still work.ly. That\u2019s when I went to the nearest store and bought a completely different set.

I use them daily, be it on my commute to work, at the gym, or out for a run, and they have help up nicely. They only real negative aspect of them are that they are not noise cancelling, or even dampening headphones. I have to turn them up pretty loud to drowned out any outside noise which, unfortunately, allows other people around you to noise from the headphones as well, but for the price they are worth it.On a side note, the headphones are be sold as bulk so they will not come in the sam packaging that you see them in the store,.

The cord has a little bit of grip and the connecting end has like a hard cover to protect the wires inside from being pulled to easly like with cheap head phones which then causes sound to fade away sometimes or completly makes one side broken so now u gata walk around with one earbud. Basically this head phones will prevent that from happening they are the best.",

Cons:  Straight plug, 'Supreme Sound', require equaliser    These earphones have crisp strong bass, flat mids, and sharp highs- which is great if you like those descriptions. I dislike all three. I used to buy Skullcandy specifically because they avoided all three.  If you are familiar with the older Ink'd line, do not expect these to sound the same. The bass is punchy not boosted, the mids are weak and flat not expansive, and the highs are annoyingly piercing.  The previous Ink'd line did have muted, almost muddy highs, but over-isolating them to a painful degree is not an improvement- especially not at the expense of mids.    They CAN produce fantastic sound, which I can tweak if I have access to a decent equaliser. I buy in-ears for travel though, and my portables have terrible equalisers. I need in-ears to sound at least near my preferences out-of-the-box, and at the very least not have shrill, painful highs.     Update: burn-in does not fix highs (not that I was expecting different), but double- and triple-flanged tips from other IEMs help. Still too harsh for me without dropping EQ bands.    Two stars because while they are still great earphones for about fifteen, the highs are atrocious. You may like the new sound stage better. I will be giving mine away.",

        "body": "I bought these headphones thinking they had the volume control also, but it is only the pause/fast forward/rewind button. other than that, the sound is good, and the price was good. I use these to workout in, sad to say that i had bought two different Beats earbuds headphones and both of them messed up. never paying that much for headphones again",
