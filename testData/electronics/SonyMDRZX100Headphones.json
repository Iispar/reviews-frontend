        "body": "I got this headphones a couple of months ago and since then they've become my most used ones. These headphones are incredibly good. The sound is completely comparable with a highly priced pair of headphones. The bass is good. The sound isolation is not good tho since I can still hear noise around me when I use them, but is barely needed compared to the quality of the sound when playing music. I could notice sounds and instruments in songs that I've never noticed before with other headphones. And these are really good to watch movies.They are compatible with every music/sound device that I own like my laptop, phone, mp3 player and radio.The design is very comfortable and the quality of the material is acceptable. I like the way you can easily fold them to make them fit in your backpack or in a pouch for protection. As soon as I opened the box I put them in my head and I could notice that they are very strong and thanks to the material they are made of they adjust to your head very easily. I like how firm these are after a couple of hours wearing them while doing chores they still in place. They feel as equally comfortable around your neck as in your head.The quality of the cable is very good and it's made with a very strong material which is always one of the specs I look the most when buying headphones. You won't need to worry about them breaking only about the tangles. I do not like the &#34;L&#34; shape jack because I can't connect them on my cellphone while it has a cover on and I think these would be way better with a mic added.But overall they are really good and you definitely get more than what you pay for.",

The position of the over-ear piece (I'm sure this has a name but I don't know it) is somewhat flexible, which provides a comfortable fit, and that this same piece folds down flat makes the headphones pack nicely.The padding is just right, and while these aren't noise-canceling, they do keep most extraneous noise out, even with music, etc., played at low-moderate volume.",

The only thing is that the right-angle plug-in has taken a beating due to my reaching for things.  The sound quality reviews for this model are much better than the replacement Sony MDRZX110AP ZX Series Extra Bass Smartphone Headset with Mic so I decided to buy a replacement while they're still available.  I will be using a 3-ft extension cable with the new headphones.",

These, so far, are my &#34;go to&#34; headphones when I travel. In fact, I've showcased this product to my audience, and now I see teenagers (on a budget) buying these. Thankfully, these come in different colors, and the quality of the music is crisp. One thing that I would like to fix, is the amount of Bass this set has. But besides that, these should be added to your cart or at least your wishlist for now.",

        "body": "I was thinking  about spending around a hundred bucks on a set of headphones, because I was doing  some work on my computer where the sound reproduction was fairly important.  The earbuds I had just weren't cutting it.  And my previous headphones had a cord ripped out a couple months ago.  Sony was not on the list I was considering.  But I couldn't make up my mind between the Sennheisers, Audio-Technicas, and Shures, though I was leaning towards the Shures, having had an excellent pair previously.  While I was reading specs and reviews, I noticed these, and they had four and a half stars, and cost $16.  I figured, that's less than the difference in price between the ones I was looking at, so what the heck?  I always need a pair of decent ones for when I'm doing stuff outside, and I can't afford to use a hundred dollar pair that might get destroyed like the last ones.  The impedance is only 24 ohms, so they'll be plenty loud (32 ohms is fairly standard these days, which gives you less volume.  The lower the ohms, the higher the volume for the same amount of voltage.)  The frequency response is listed as 12-22,000 Hz.  Most cheap headphones and earbuds list 20-20,000 Hz, which is about the range of human hearing, and that is usually an exaggeration on their part.  In any case, the Sony MDRZX100s, while certainly not as good as the expensive Shures I  used to have, are a great buy for the money.  The sound is clear enough for what I needed, and while I still look forward to getting some audiophile phones, I am in no hurry anymore.  These are very adequate.  I would have preferred a longer cord (this is about 4 feet).  They are lightweight and very comfortable on my head for hours at a time, and right and left are clearly marked.  By the way, you will likely do less damage to your hearing using headphones than earbuds.  People tend to listen to speakers at a lower volume, measured in the ear canal, than headphones, and to earbuds loudest of all.",

The sound is quite good even on a crowded airplane; the padding around the ears is very comfortable, but also hasn't peeled or frayed.  After all of this time, these still look and work like new.  They are pretty light, but the padding blocks out some of the outside noise, which is awesome if you're trying to listen to quieter music without the additional sound of your co-workers in the background. :)",

If you like heavy bass these aren't for you.  Some newer headphones can push heavier bass, but ZX100 is most balanced in my opinion.  They are also light weight and comfortable.  I can use them 4 to 6 hours and not feel tired.Still these are ten bucks, no way these can compete with more expensive headphones.  But if you want to spend some where under $30, might want to give these a try.  If used on a computer with equalizer, these can improve.",

With somewhat rough usage, these headphones can withstand a fair bit of wear and tear before damage becomes visible. The sound quality is some of the best I have experienced with headphones under $20, you can get a fair bit of bass and easily enough volume to block out the noise around you without blowing out your ears.",
