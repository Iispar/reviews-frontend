I can only assume putting that much strain on the headphone jack didn't do the circuit board many favors, so I don't fault the unit for that. I still use my old Clip+ while out on runs and it performs like a champ.My one gripe is that, for a product that literally is called &#34;Clip+&#34;, the clip sucks. Any by that I mean it breaks very quickly and leaves jagged plastic behind afterwards. There is no way to replace the broken clip, as it breaks at the joint on the main body, so it mainly just becomes a standard (but small) MP3 player. As long as you have a pocket, you're fine, but it seems a bit odd to market something with a clip that breaks in a matter of months under moderate use (clipped to shorts or shirt while running... which is kinda the point). SanDisk should probably beef up the plastic a bit or make a replaceable clip assembly.",

Yes, i have a smart phone that I can put music on and listen to with cool bluetooth headphones, but I just love how compact and easy to use this thing is. And the battery life is fantastic, needing charged once every other week or so with my usage pattern! (Suck that, smartphone!)It uses a mini-USB connection to charge and to connect to a computer. It also has a slot for a micro-SD card (sorry, don't recall the maximum size for that).It boots up quickly and shuts down smartly if I leave it on accidentally. The screen is small, but big enough to see what I'm listening too and to navigate the easy to use menu system (and is in color, too).It's a great, solid little product and--most importantly--IT'S PURPLE!!! (Yes, that was a serious consideration for my purchasing of it. :P) If all you want is quick, easy music then this is most definitely the product for you! If you want pictures and movies and bluetooth and internet, then go get a smartphone or a tablet. I'll tell you though, this thing weighs next to nothing so doesn't slow me down while jogging and, perhaps second best of all (best being purple!), no one would rob me for it (unless they really like purple, as I do).",

I wrote to Sandisk to complain, saying how great the Clip + is, especially since it has a superb recording function and can play audiobooks without issues. The guy wrote back and asked me what features I like about the Clip+ so he can recommend a newer version. I just TOLD you what I like!I notice that the company has copious time to reply to every single negative comment made about the (seemingly) crappy new Clip Jam. Why can't they just spend that time either making a superior product or just making sure long-time consumers are getting what they want? In a tiresome world where built-in obsolescence has become a religion for techies, who seem to think that newer is always better, I was impressed by Sandisk's commitment to keeping this awesome MP3 player out there. Now I will have to look at other products instead.I wish all the people who love this product would take the time to complain to the manufacturer about their sad decision. Maybe they would reconsider!",

We want a dedicated music player to take into our vehicles, and this is it. We have 2 x vehicles made before mini-stereo-jacks were standard in most car radios, so we had no way to plug-and-play our MP3 tracks in our vehicles. We have CD players in both, but that gets old -- having to haul them around. Plus, the songs don't shuffle. SO we bought a couple of FM tuners that the SanDisk Clip plugs into, and that solved the problem. I put a velcro dot on the back and attached it in a convenient spot on each dashboard.So far, I've dumped about 2,000 songs in this tiny device, and it's working great! I just got the SanDisk Ultra 32 gig Ultra card, and I can't imagine that I'll ever run out of playlists or songs.Too bad they stopped making this!Having fun with it -- recommended!",

The fact that you could insert a larger microSD to expand your storage is always good but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever use this function.In terms of drawbacks, for my purposes, I really can\u2019t think of any.

Unfortunately, and the only reason why Im giving it 3 instead of 5 stars, is because it freezes on me consistently. Every few songs (considering it is a shuffle) I skip, it starts to freeze if I go a little too fast when skipping through the songs and sometimes the freezing time ranges from 1-10 minutes. It kind of pisses me off because I use it in the gym and blast my music to get into the zone and when it freezes, I need t wait for it to get back to playing. I don't know if its just mine or it happens to others but, its just a great hinder and disturbance in my lifting, mentally as well. Other than that, it's very loud and is very handy and I love it.",

        "body": "This product has both good and bad features. First the good: it is not just an MP3 player - it will play many different digital formats including MP3, WAVE, AIFF, and several others, intermixed. The lossless formats allow the reproduction of sound waveforms with absolutely no waveform distortion or tone coloring, so the audio quality is as good as a CD player. It is intended for use with earbuds, but can also supply audio to a Hi-Fi system. It is tiny and very light, and will run for several hours on its internal battery. One bad characteristic is its GUI - there are many modes, options, and settings, so the menu tree is complex and not very user-friendly. Another problem is its battery charging circuit: if the battery is run down, you cannot run the player from the charger while the battery is charging. This is not a problem if you only listen to the audio when you are out jogging. Another problem is the USB connector, which is used both to charge the battery and load the audio tracks. This connector is tiny, but very sturdy, with a metal shell, but is not well supported inside the player. Unfortunately, my player was totally destroyed after I had used it for just a few months when the charger cord was accidentally jerked and the USB socket broke away from the motherboard inside.",

I do not like the pc interface software so I copy files to a micro sd card and insert it. The player takes a minute or two to update the file matrix after loading the memory card. After that it plays quite well. The sound is good and solid. Battery will discharge if you forget to fully power the player off when not in use. Otherwise it plays fine for my four hour work shift.",

I baby them and protect them, and all but my last 2 Sansa Clip+ have lasted several years, they still work well.

I called Sansa and I was told that they would replace the product with another 8mb Sansa product but that it would take a few weeks for me to get the product.  After reading a couple other Sansa reviews, I'd have to say that the SansaDisk is cheaply made.  I can only hope that the replacement I receive works better than this one.

And if you run out of space you can buy an extra memory chip and put it in there. The battery lasts so long as well! Is durable too! Would buy this over and over again. Love sandisk!

        "body": "I am an avid audio book &#34;reader,&#34; and I want a dedicated device for that. (I never use my phone for books because I don't want to run the battery down.) I have had several of these amazing little Sansa Clips. People are always surprised when I pull it out of my pocket and say, &#34;I have 30 books on here.&#34; I'm an long-time Audible subscriber and also download books from my public library through OverDrive. It's effortless to do with this device. The sound quality is wonderful. And it's very competitively priced. One nice feature in using this for audio books is that I can adjust the speed. People can hear and comprehend speech faster than people can read aloud, so I can set it on fast, and cover more pages in less time. For a person like me who is dyslexic, this has been a God-send. I have an small speaker I can plug it into if I don't want to wear ear phones and I can also plug it into my car stereo system. I am always amazed at people who spend a good deal of time in a car every day who don't listen to audio books. What an opportunity they are missing. And when I recommend audio, I always pull my Sansa Clip out of my pocket to show them. (I have had several models and never been disappointed.)",

I don't need videos or album art or any other features - just an mp3 player that plays my music and audio books.This one has a slot for a micro SD card which comes in handy since I have A LOT of music and audio books to tote around with me. The battery life from a single charge is about 10-15 hours in my experience. I can usually get two solid business days out of it  (primarily use it at work).I highly recommend this device for a straight-forward no-frills mp3 player. It's USB so you don't need any software to run it, which is also a plus as this doesn't limit its use to Windows users.",

I called customer support and they told me two things to do that didn't work. Final option was total reboot which wiped out 6 books I had loaded. I put those books on my old player and low and behold it is working fine and have been using it several months now. Haven't gone back to new player but probably will have to if old one dies. Newer is not always better. Too bad they can't just keep making a product and quit trying to update it",

The instructions were too limited for me, as I think SanDisk thinks everyone is now so familiar with the latest digital technology that specific written instructions would be redundant. Too bad, as I suspect many of their customers fall into the same category as me. But, the main reason I gave it a three star was because it completely quit working after roughly a month of very limited use. Amazon did credit my account with the full purchase price when I sent it back to them and this encouraged me to purchase more items through them in the future.",

        "body": "My SanDisk clip was supposed to be a replica of my old one, which I had lost at the gym. I purchased directly from Amazon to minimize any risks but knowing the warning that said manufacturer had discontinued product. As the instructions in booklet were very schematic, I had to call their support line, which was pretty helpful as a person responded relatively quickly and was able to help me.I was able to load music to it with no problem. However, the main disadvantage is the ear piece they supplied. The insert does not fit snuggly into the player as it is too big. Yes, you can get music but the most minute vibration (walking, sitting, getting in and out of car) will cause a disconnect, sometimes momentary but many times requiring you to manually jiggle the insert to reconnect again. A major hassle that ruins the experience as you do not want to be listening to music that stops every few seconds while you are simply walking or exercising. Such a simple design to get right and yet not done. Do they want to sell additional peripherals? Now I will either have to return entire product or buy other ear pieces.Otherwise this is small and functional player for MP3 and other media.",

This is a relatively minor inconvenience, but it does require navigating back to track 10 after track 9. The other issue I have had is that my device will randomly shut down in the middle of playing for no discernible reason. When I turn it back on, it picks right back up where it left off, so while it is a nuisance, it isn't something that led me to return the device.",

I expanded the memory on one of them (holds more music than the 32GB iPod I gave my daughter!). I use one for music during workouts and the other for audiobooks. Advice: purchase a good set of headphones for great, clean sound. Even after 4 years, this has proven to be quite a useful and reliable device.",

The second one started acting strangely within a couple of weeks and was still functioning most of the time so I kept it. The hello screen would not come on and the book/music last being listened to would start anyway. The menu and select buttons would simply stop working and then out of the blue 10 or 15 minutes later the whole thing would rapid fire through all commands it had previously gotten. At times the screen would flash goodbye and just shut down and when I turned it on it would be back where I had started it before, sometimes HOURS earlier. I should have given up then and mailed it back because there is a 30 day return policy and these have been discontinued by the manufacturer. I am right back where I started with the first one. NOTHING turns it back on. Occasionally plugging it in to a computer will prompt it to say goodbye or to indicate that it is charging, and no amount of reset or other commands bring it back to life. I'm an old person who is using this sitting still and plugging it in to charge in safe computers. It has only ever downloaded books from Audible. There is absolutely no reason to suspect that my lifestyle or use of this machine killed it. These are just VERY fragile and buggy and should not be purchased. Let the remaining stock be sent to people patient enough to keep trying to return and replace them. Find something better for your $70 and if you have already purchased one, do NOT tolerate the bugs. Replace as soon as it starts acting strangely or you're going to be out your money.",

I don't think the Sansa is broke because it still plays the music but my computer doesn't recognize it when I go to recharge, so I think it is only the wire/plug that came with it is broke.  This one is no longer made, so if I can't find the wire, I will have to get a newer version.Since Windows 10 will no longer support Music/DVD media, I want to get as many songs as I can on whichever device I get, be it this one or a newer one.This one was great for music.  I never really used much of the other stuff - recorder or audio books and the FM radio was fine but here in Boston, not one FM station plays oldies (1940's, 50's, 60's) as a dedicated station.  I found one on AM but I have to listen to him on a portable radio near a window -- even my stereo won't pick him up because it is not near a window -- imagine that.So,  since I can't find the wire (any help here please), I guess I will go with the newer version.",
