        "body": "What a shame we have come to in the gaming business world. I don't mind DLC, as long as it feels like an expansion to the game, not something that was purposely taken out to be sold later. I had that feeling with SimCity throughout. When I originally bought the game, I easily put 60-70 hours into it within the first two weeks, but a few things happened. One, I had a hard time dealing with the very restrictive map sizes of the game. Too many times did I have to destroy and rebuild just to fit the map size, and I just got bored of that. Two, there just aren't enough features to sustain long term play, unless you want to buy into the DLC, which is pricey. Compared to its predecessors, the game felt like half a game to begin with. Third, the forced online component just kills the single player experience. Why do I have to play with others if I don't want to? And if I don't want to, why must I take on another City to make up for the lack of space in my original one? And on top of that, I don't find people who actually want to play a smart cooperative game. Unless you have friends that are just like you and really want to play that way, you're basically gonna have a hard time finding good players. All in all, I could've given this a 1 star like many have, but I was engaged to a certain point before I realized how poorly implemented this game was. Just sad really.",

The God like feel that made the all other Sim Cities so great is missing greatly from this game. I have never been a fan of the Sims, yet this is the game EA has created, an expanded Sims universe on a regional scale, not a 10 years advanced Sim City that improves upon what made Sim City 4 so incredible. I am sad to say that after 20 years of Sim City This game has destroyed my love of the series. If you love the Sims, you will love this game, but if you are a true Sim City fan, the one Will Wright created you will be sorely disappointed and cheated.",

        "body": "I am a huge fan of the Sim City games and have been for years. I was thrilled when I heard that a new Simcity game was being released and I couldn't wait to start playing my favorite, but now updated, game. I purchased the game through a local retailer and I wish now that I had read the reviews before wasting $60.00. This is a completely unusable piece of garbage software that simply doesn't work.First off, creating a game such as this that can only be played and stored through an online server is a disaster. I prefer private gaming and relying upon the speed and capability of my personal computer. However, this is not possible with Simcity 5. BUT, if I could only GET to the server, that would be further along than I have been able to get.After installing the game, the game will not run. I've installed and re-installed the software four times to no avail. The only message that I get is 'there is something wrong with the installation of this game, please reinstall.' The one time that I was able to get past this window (after the fourth install), I got to the 'select server' portion of the game only to discover than clicking on the connect to server button shut the program down. After a number of tries, I finally gave up and uninstalled the game from my system.I've had my fair share of games that, once installed, I did not care for. That's part of the risk in any purchase such as this. But to have spent $60.00 on a software program that is this flawed is completely inexcusable, particularly since I can't get a refund of the money spent.EA, you REALLY messed up on this one and you are deserving of the scorn that is being directed your way!My advice is to absolutely avoid this game unless you're a fan of throwing your money away. The bucks I spent on this hideous mess of computer programming would have been better spent picking up the dog poo from my back yard. Worthless!",

They absolutely destroyed the Command & Conquer series after C&C3.If you are an intelligent, discerning human being you will join me in boycotting ALL EA products.

If you buy this you will never own the game or your saves, you only licence them from EA for however long they decide to keep the servers alive and EA is notorious for killing off games before their time. That's right you're not allowed to save or load, must now log in and queue a la MMO and are locked out of the game as soon your connection to the servers is lost, all this for a private single-player experience. It's a sloppy attempt at multi-player, wedged into a single-player game in a thinly veiled attempt to hide the draconian DRM and the forfeiture of your rights as a consumer. If you don't want this to become the standard for all games, vote against it with your hard earned dollars.",

EA will state that the servers are just too 'overloaded' and that no server system could possibly handle 80 bazillion people playing.But if you buy a game, you expect to play it. That's how it always worked. Nowadays you gotta wait a week after the launch day. I've never heard of 1 hour loading times to play single player. That's crazy. EA must think we're all unemployed and don't have jobs or families or s*** to do.And even then, if you get in, you're still playing with fire. Will the server boot you out? Will it actually save your city? Why can't you save your game, destroy your city, and reload your game? Why is the city so small? Why do I need other mini cities? The endless questions.I've heard that this is a $80 facebook game. People are rightly pissed off of the poor customer feedback and getting ripped off. The always online DRM is just not the way to go. People understand about pirating games and whatnot, but making it so people can't play the games is bad. Steam has it's problems but it's gained my trust. Origin? Dear Lord. No way am I touching that weak thing.And EA wants to make money too. But inadequate servers and a 'eh' to people mad about the purchase to your product doesn't help things.EDIT: Actually, it is worse than the Diablo III launch. It's been about five days now and this has become more than 'whiny butthurt videogamers who will buy the next EA game'. It's not about the game anymore. It's about the worst videogame launch...ever. They were seriously, seriously unprepared. People can't play the game. And the always online deal? Does that even make sense for a single player game?It's a good lesson for any videogamer to learn is that you need to WAIT until you make a purchase. Don't believe the hype, the pics, the pretty words, your fanboyism, or one or two reviews. Wait until the dust settles, and then make your choice. Don't pre-order. Don't buy at midnight. Wait.Of course, how much you want to bet EA or some other bunch of boobs try this thang again and see it blow up in their faces.And you're really gonna trust this game 3 months down the road after everything has been 'ironed out?'

SimCity 2000 devoured chunks of my youth whole. Later SimCity 3000 was the mainstay game of the early 2000's on my PC along other greats such as Diablo II and StarCraft. SimCity 4 was good in it's own ways even if it didn't appeal to me in the same magnitude that it's predecessors did.The pedigree and nostalgia I have toward this series is what makes my ultimate decision to not purchase the game so difficult. Unfortunately, companies like EA have got to get the message that implementing DRM (digital rights management) such as requiring users to be constantly connected to the internet to play a game that is heavily slanted to the single-player experience is not okay. Forcing persistent connections to overwhelmed servers and implementing wait-times to play my game is not my idea of a 'good' gaming experience. Taking my save files and holding them hostage on a remote server is not my idea of a 'good' gaming experience.Very disappointed. I will not be purchasing this SimCity and if EA has any thought to the fans of the series - you know the people who buy the games - they'll remove this DRM and stop punishing their fans/customers.",

        "body": "Very rarely do I give 1 star reviews, but if I spend $60 on a game, I expect to be able to play it. I ended up getting 5 hours into a city (after waiting 20 minutes in a queue to play a game), only to get issues with my city 'not processing properly'. I was forced to do a roll back, and lost 2 hours of work. I spent another few hours getting it back to the way I had it before my save started having problems, and went to sleep. Now, today when I try to load my game, I get the following error: 'Unable to load city at this time. Please Try Again Later'. I have no idea if my save is gone for good, or if it's a temporary problem. The server status is green and is supposedly working, but I can't load my city.If I could play the game perfectly without any problems, I'd give it a 2/5 at best, because I literally filled the entire map up in less than 5 hours of gameplay. The excuse EA gave in making small maps is mediocre at best, and it shows how wrong they are in the early reviews. They say they want to give us maps that size because it might lag people with slow computers, but what about the people with good computers who want to have a map they can build in for longer than 5 hours without filling it up completely? Apparently in their eyes, multiplayer gameplay can only be as large as the weakest link.Besides the obvious drawbacks in the map size, the entire game seems to be 'dumbed down' from Simcity 4. No subways, no water pipes, it's almost as if the game was made for Facebook. There are major graphical issues as well, and tile problems. For example, I had a bridge across a river, and I accidently made it a suspension bridge (Which looked horrible, because there was only a single 'tower' on the bridge), so I removed the road completely. However, when I tried to make another bridge in the exact same place, it said it was too steep. Since there is no way to go back to a previous save besides having your save glitch and being forced to do it, I hadto end up bulldozing 5 skyscrapers just to fit a bridge in.All in all, it's been a disappointment so far. I can't play my save at all, even though the server seems to be working, and the map can get filled up in a few hours of gameplay. Oh, I also remember playing for about an hour while I had lost connection to the SimCity servers, which wasn't because I was offline, it was because of some server problems with SimCity. Nothing I did saved, I ended up having to start over again.Update: It's now been almost 36 hours since I was last able to play my save, SimCity support won't tell me if it's a server problem or if it's gone for good, so I'm going to create a new save on another server. Very disappointing.",

Even though it might work for a few people, just take a look at EA forums to see a sea of angry consumers unable to load their cities. This DRM excuse is a JOKE. I don't need to be online 24/7 to fully enjoy this particular game. In fact, there are many users testing how far they can go without Internet connection once they're ingame. And guess what: 99% is done inside YOUR computer, unlike EA/Maxis stated. They servers exist only to load and save games. AND THAT'S IT. They turned off all other main reasons for online play (Achivements, leaderboards, multi-city play). What's the point of this DRM crap then??? They can't even store a save game. It sucks to invest a good ammount of time in a region to see it all lost on a server error. Server problem asides, the bugs. Oh my dear Lord, this is game is INFESTED by nasty bugs. Do a quick search and see what I mean. 1/10 of your city actually go to work, there's no commute, traffic/pathfinder is glitchy as hell, services stop working randomly (had major budgjet problems cause of that), and many many many other issues. We all paid $60~$80 AMERICAN DOLAR to play beta testers. Shame on you EA, shame on you! STAY AWAY OF THIS GAME!",

        "title": "Really disappointed, and not because of the server issues...",
        "body": "I've been a die hard Sim City fan since the beginning, and I have to say, I'm really disappointed in EA and Maxis' latest offering.I luckily did not have any of the server connection issues others had. But even without those problems, the game has several flaws that ruin it for me. It seems obvious that EA's ham fisted DRM and DLC approach to game building is taking over, as right out of the box you feel like you are missing major content that should have been included in the $60 'Limited Edition'.The maps are TINY! I mean, picture the smallest map size in SC4, cut it in half, and that's about the size of the maps you get in Sim City. I laugh browsing through the achievements; some of them, like reach 1,000,000 population, I can't even see how it would be possible. I've already completely filled my map area and I barely have 15,000 people. If you were hoping for SC4 style gameplay, with massive cities and connected suburbs, you can forget it. Even Cities XL seemed to do this aspect of the game better than Sim City.The road building is better, but they left out some key features, like filler tiles and steep grade bases for many buildings, which leave your cities looking glitchy and with empty areas around zones. It would be nice if they had some filler tiles that you could use to fill in dead space like in Cities XL. Also, the building variety is terrible, and it doesn't seem like there are any options for user created content like there was in SC4, so I'm guessing you'll just be building the same city over and over again until you just get tired of the game in a month. Although, I can bet EA will be adding 'content' like buildings later and charging you an arm and a leg for the 'privilege' like they've done on other Sim titles of late.The always on DRM internet connection requirement really sucks. If you enjoyed playing SC4 while traveling, you can pretty much forget it. Sim City is supposed to be a solo activity. I can understand that some people like the multiplayer addition, but to require always on connection for everyone is just plain stupid.This is just the tip of the iceberg. The point is, if you like The Sims, Cities XL, or Sim City Societies, you'll probably like this version as well. But if your hoping for an updated version of SC4, you'll be very disappointed, just like I am.(EDIT) 3/17/13OK, so after playing for a couple weeks, I've come across yet another major flaw. So the game's always on connection means that your game saves are stored to the server or something, and the game makers in all of their wisdom have decided that you don't need an option to save the game on your own, and that it will save it for you. It's hard to click on that 'quit' button without hitting save first, your brain is telling you not to trust the game to save your work for you, but oh well, it works, right?Well, no, it doesn't work. Lately (about 60% of the time) I've been getting an error message that the game is not 'processing correctly' and asking if I want to roll my city back to a stable point, or abandon the city completely. So the big project I've been working on for the last two hours is now completely gone and I'm back to where I was when I started today. If only I had a save option so I could save my work. Thanks guys, that's quite a 'feature'.I wish games were returnable and I could get my $60 back.",

Even if it was at 20 bucks I still could not recommend this game..__________________________________________________________________________I played betas 1,2, and 3.... each one got better and better. Final release comes out and I'm having issues I haven't had since beta 1... such as BSOD which happens only on sim city and only on my main pc... (driver?)  It ran smooth in beta 3...The always online DRM has shown how bad it truly is... many people who bought it simply can't log in... And instead of having a  teired server system... each sever is seperate like an MMO so if you save a city on one server you have to be on that server to play it again. Que times to log back into your servers are making it hard to continue any games.  Servers are also crashing atm.  Some issues are to be expected, but 3 closed betas and no open beta tells me they didn't care much about ironing out the issues before launch.  Just now i've waited in que for 40 mins to get into my game and its still counting.  Thats after a BSOD followed by a server crash as soon as I got back in :-/ ....My advice is do not PREorder any EA titles... wait 3-7 days after release and see if it's any better.The actual gameplay for this game is fairly fun. City sizes are too small, and like others say  I am disappointed you can't edit the roads in the regional view... old versions of sim city could connect every neighboring down directly with roads... not so in sim city.. you can have 2 sitting right next to each other and only have rail.. water.. or nothing to connect them directly..The always on DRM also scares me cause EA is pretty bad about shutting down servers after a year or 2... we'll see...Until they remove the DRM / fix all the issues my recommendation and review score will stay as a PASS and a 1 star...",

Maxis made a press release about their vision. Now, Sim City right now is a decent little game, but if they take it further with patching into the realm of a true MMO good on them, do it. Either way, the game is amazing...disclaimer when it works. They still have a lot of glitches going on and they need to get more people on it. Perhaps get some fresh people. I know me and a lot of other people get this error where the game crashes your entire computer after you meet the good old blue screen of death that you didn't know existed past Windows 2000, or whenever you finally stopped seeing that thing. I wouldn't recommend buying this at full price but like I said when it works this game is amazing, and I'm excited to see where they take it.

City's should take countless hours to fund and build... not hours! This is not because the game is too easy but rather EA has decided to severely limit the size of the city you can build. Like other games EA is releasing, downloadable content and add-on expensions are becoming the norm which likely means we will see a update soon that allows me to 'purchase' the right to expand my city.Furthermore, goodluck getting online and playing for two hours. The servers are so overloaded it is almost impossible. With such a few building options in this release, I can hardly reccomend this to even veteren sim city fans such as myself. The economy controls they introduced are nice but I am more then happy to continue playing sim city 4 and rival sim Anno 2024 until a alternative comes up.This game is not worth the current asking price. Perhaps at 29.99 It would be a worthwhile purchase.",

It forces you to be in servers with many different people even if you just want to mess around by yourself and play the game on your own computer. And then the servers don't work either. I could not get one game to start so far. EA and their horrible DRM has ruined another game. I'm sure the server issues will be fixed sooner or later, but if there isn't a solid single player mode that doesn't require you to be connected to the internet all the time, then this will probably just be a blown 60$ for me. Lesson learned, EA will ruin any game you have loved for years with their oppressive grasp for cash DRM style.",

City sizes need to increase.2) The limited road network options leave me yearning for more road layout options. One way streets, overpasses, roundabouts, and traffic circles.3) No option to play single player, offline. EA Games deciding protecting their intellectual property is more important than letting their consumers the product they've paid for.Disappointing start, maybe they will fix it. At the core this game is great and it has so much potential. Hopefully it will not be as paid DLC, necessary to make this the game it should have been from the start.",

The companies claim this is to 'enhance' the experience by allowing the user to have friends lists and share their video game achievements with everyone else whether they want to or not, but everyone knows the real reason for the 'always-on' requirement is to prevent piracy.Sure, protecting your bottom line is a good reason for doing something, but for the love of god, why can't these companies ensure the legitimate player can actually use the product? A decade of development, ten years to work out all the bugs, and this...this catastrophic failure on every level is the result?

        "body": "So, first of all, I got the game on March 5th, and I played it for several hours. Honestly, during that time the game was genuinely awesome and fun. The simulation is great, and the details, sheer level of development and thought put into everything is truly impressive. Evidently many designers, modelers, programmers, and other talented people worked extremely hard on this game. So, before I detail the reason for my one star rating, I would like to commend them for that hard work and give them my condolences for the sad death of their great game that occurred to reasons that were probably beyond their control.The day after I got the game (March 6th) I started it up, ready to continue building my cities, but it couldn't connect to the server I had originally used. I didn't realize at first just how serious of a problem this was until I tried to connect to another available server, only to find that the cities I had built were nowhere to be found. Eventually I found out that the cities you build are ONLY saved on EA's servers and ONLY on the server you select at the beginning of the game. This includes private games you play by yourself!!! Furthermore, if you don't have an internet connection or if EA's server fails you CANNOT play the game AT ALL!This means that for 4 hours on March 6th I couldn't play the game I had just payed $60 for because the server where I had stored my city was unavailable. After this, needless to say, I called EA and asked for a refund. Of course, this was only after hunting for 45 minutes on EA's site for some kind of way to call them on the phone, finally finding a 'Call Back' service, talking to a 'Game Advisor' for 15 minutes, talking to a supervisor for 30 minutes, being told several times I couldn't get a refund, and finally having the supervisor give up and issue the refund he adamantly told me I couldn't get.All in all, not only do I not recommend SimCity to anyone, I don't recommend EA as a companyin general, and this includes all of their games on the PC. Their Origin service is just a glorified way of forcing always-on anti-piracy measures for their games and their customer service is dishonest and frustrating. Although the game itself is good, it is useless if you can't have control over where you save or if you can't play on your own offline. Please, don't make the same mistake I did! Avoid this game at all costs!!",

Because EA has no idea what they're freaking doing and can't keep servers up to save their collective asses.  The always-online, seemingly common rollback problem makes it seem as though EA never saw what happened with D3.  If you make that always-online decision and can't keep enough servers up, you're by definition incompetent.

I'm still waiting on them to fix some of the bugs and some of the options they turned off to minimize server load (i.e. cheetah speed). But playing today has been enjoyable. I'm upgrading my review to a 3. Once they fix the aforementioned issues and hopefully enlarge the city map size, I will be a happy camper. Could be a 5 star game once all is said and done!I've had this game since it released on March 5th. I waited anxiously all day for the UPS guy to come. He finally arrived around 3pm, and with that, I rushed upstairs to install and play! After a few minute installation, I was greeted with an hour long update download and installation. No problem, right? I'm patient. I've been waiting almost 10 years for this to come out, so what's an extra hour? But here we are, 3 days into the launch and I still have yet to play a single second of the game. This whole server business is for the birds. I just want to play my own little city in my own little world on my own little computer. But nooooooo! I must be connected to EA servers, which they have 8 of for the ENTIRE world to play on. Awesome. I hope they fix it soon so I can update this review with something more positive, but at this point, I'd give it no stars if I could. I'm so frustrated!",

From what I've seen so far of the game, the maps are really small and the game feels heavily restrictive.  I would not recommend this game to anyone.

I want my money back, and after the way customers have been treated, I want to see EA put out of business forever.  This is ridiculous, and AMAZON should step up, and pressure EA to refund everyone.Update:Yep the servers just died again, they added 4 additional servers, and they still aren't able to keep up.  I want to hear from a class action lawyer.  I want my money back, or I want the game updated so that I can play it unencumbered by their servers indefinitely.  I don't think that is unreasonable.Obviously a significant number of people are angry with Electronic Arts for the debacle.  The lesson here should be, stop forcing applications to DIE when you're servers go down.  We get it, you want a revenue stream, and you're trying to move us towards service based games where we pay you forever.  Certainly some game will bring that kind of revenue, but this isn't that kind of game.  EA, you should have done your homework and honored the franchise.  SimCity isn't the kind of game that you can turn into a subscription based cash cow.  I don't want Farmville, if I did, I'd play on Face Book FOR FREE.  The quality of the simulation is what makes SimCity fun, not playing with random strangers all over the globe (which YOU CAN NOT DO ANYWAY).Get a clue, remove the encumbering server requirement, allow for reasonably sized cities, or start issuing refunds, before the lawyers do.  When your customers start petitioning the White House, it's not just a botched release, you are in full damage control mode.",

It completely kills the fun.The maps are too smallThe AI is terribleThe great works fail to sync completely breaking the entire regionOnly one offramp into the city creates an impossible traffic nightmare for people actually playing specialized cities designed to work with the region, which defeats the entire purpose on the online multiplayer which they claim is why the need it onlineAnd any specialization takes up so much space that your village sized city of 60k people with only one highway offramp reaches it's limits, can not grow any larger, and gridlock inevitably takes over.I want to love this game so much. If these bugs weren't here. If we could add more onramps to the highway, and annex surrounding land, and the great works bugs were fixed, I could see spending hundreds of dollars in DLC. But as it is now, it is not only unenjoyable, it is actually aggravating to play. I play a game to have fun, not get frustrated and pissed off.I hate you EA. You ruined 3 of my 5 most favorite games of all time. Sim City, Burnout, and SSX. I hate what you do to video games. Releasing them missing features that we had a decade ago claiming our machines can't handle them.... well they did in the 90's. Releasing half finished games promising to finish them but never do. And worse of all, nickel and diming us on DLC that should be part of the initial game for the price you sell it as.I hope you sell Maxis sometime in my lifetime so we can have a decent version of Sim City.

        "body": "First let me say, I love this game.  I'm a big fan of SimCity, and this new version is an excellent upgrade.  The problem is, you CAN'T PLAY this game without being connected to EA's Origin servers.  If you loose your network connection to Origin, the game literally stops and prevents you from playing.  If I was not such a fan of SimCity, this alone would have prevented me from buying it.  Unfortunately, that's just the beginning of the pain.EA's Origin servers have been a constant problem.  It can take hours to get connected to them.  When you do get connected, you often can't continue resume a game you previously started. The server then go down constantly.  Even when you can get and stay connected for any stretch of time, you can't send or receive friend requests, and you can't invite friends to your game.Those of us who have played other EA games recently, should not be surprised.  I'm scolding myself for buying this game, knowing that it was an EA title, and it would require a connection to Origin.  I very much regret this purchase.By requiring a connection to Origin to play, EA has ruined SimCity.  It is quite literally unplayable.  Until SimCity can be freed from EA's incompetence, don't buy.",

        "body": "Sim City 5 (confusingly called Sim City by EA) requires a constant internet connection to play.  Somehow EA didn't have the servers set up to actually handle people playing the game.  Despite paying $60 for the game I've been unable to play a single minute in my first 48 hours of owning the game.  Servers are unavailable, the game fails to load, and EA is completely unhelpful.  There's no venue to even complain to them about the game.  Do not buy this game--you won't be able to play it for weeks until they figure out their mess.Having played the beta, the granularity offered to users is frustratingly simple and basic tasks take multiple clicks through confusing menus.  Sim City 4 was a great game that was well designed to last the test of time.  Sim City 5 is just a poor attempt at a multiplayer cash cow with microtransactions.  It alienates the core gamers who have grown up playing the previous Sim City games.  There's glossy videos and pictures of great-looking cities for sure, and the graphics are refreshing, but the gameplay is as dull as watching grass grow and it's an insult to those who paid to be first to experience its failure.I'm willing to revise my rating if EA ever fulfills their end of the contractual agreement and allows me to actually play that game.  But until then, I waste hour after hour dealing with errors, update downloads, and cities that continually disappear rather than saving in the 'cloud' like they are supposed to.",

The first night was a disaster. Installing went fine if you can account for Origin being very UN-user friendly. Most the servers were busy and Oceanic, just forget it that server is completely jacked. At that time I didn't know it was completely online but I play a ton of MMO's so I can deal. The tutorial kept hanging up and wouldn't start. Finally we got it to start.This is not where the issue ended, first of all the tutorial is junk. Half of the things we learned we learned by mistake. It took me forever to figure out how to invite him to a game with me. HINT: It's hidden under all the other garbage. Half way through the game my town started to glitch out, I got stuck with a ton of protesters despite the fact what they were protesting was not happening. Followed by that a random event resulted in the loss of my entire town. My husband couldn't figure out why this was happening.I thought this was maybe just first day problems. However, we tried to play again today and after massive server hopping to finally get to a server where we could create a game, I tried to invite my husband and no matter where we went we were met with the same 'You can not  invite that player at this time, please try again.' After about 30-45 mins we said forget it and we went to go watch a movie.I work full time and have a small child and I do not mind paying the extra money to play a game to relax and enjoy at the end of the day. This is not it. My husband is fed up and is calling EA tomorrow.Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this game. At this point I am not even sure they will fix it. As a project manager, they need to fire their project team cause their programmers and producers did NOT do their jobs. Worst go-live I have ever seen.",

        "body": "The GOOD:Graphic are very nice. Switching between cities is easy and fast. You have curved roads now. You can build and Archology now as it was possible in SC2000.The BAD:Trying to get resources to the Archology in order to get it built is a pain and often in vain (Lack of control in where to ship your products)I paid out over $80 for the 'Deluxe Version' and it's not worth it. The extra little buildings aren't that impressive. Stick with the Limited You'll be happier and won't feel ripped off by EA.I can't understand why these guys didn't/don't listen to the the gamers and see what their insight is. I've spent hundreds of hours on SC4 and know what I want and SC5 has not delivered.UPDATE*****I've been playing this game for about 4 weeks now. EA has managed to add servers and connectivity problems have been resolved. Overall this game is NOT like the old SimCity4 game. You can't manage infrastructure to the level of SC4, they made it for a lack of a better phrase, 'idiot proof'. It's been over simplified. The Financial management has also been reduced to simply taxes etc. You can't really manage education, fire departments, Police etc. You have the choice to simply close a school etc. Mass transit is also severely limited. There are no more subways, you can't build highways.With health issues, there is a 'germy' factor where you can deploy health vehicles that visit homes to 'teach' sims to live healthier. But even if you have a healthy home for the Sims the messages continue to state 'this place is germy'The maps are too small and the feel of the city is not at all what it was like in SC4. You also cannot control your exports on a level that would make it possible to whom you want to ship your Product. In this version you simply plop RCI, plop schools, other minor infrastructure and hope for the best. You also cannot plop building unless there is a road present, which makes it very difficult to determine where you would like your buildings placed. The 'grid snap' feature for roads can be helpful, but many times it 'snaps' a road to point that you simply do not want and can be very annoying.It is difficult to run a profitable city and the balance between unemployment and unfilled jobs is sporadic at best. So far I have not been able to balance employment. Simply put this game needs more work.So far I have not heard if there can be custom building made for this game as in SC4 but I have a feeling that since it's a server based game the answer is no.My final opinion of this game:It is interesting at first, I have pretty much lost interest and am very disappointed in the game itself. It is nothing like SC4 and you can see that Will Wright was not involved in the making of this game. Another miss for EA. Perhaps they should start listening to the gamers so they can understand what we are actually looking for. It is obvious that they are not hardcore SimCity4 players nor have they played it for many years.Hope this helps. I'm going to play SimCity 4 now.

        "body": "I would really like to give this game 4 or 5 stars for its potential.  I really want to give this game 1 or 2 for being the most colossal screw-up of a video game I've ever seen.  I gave it 3 stars because I have fun playing it for 2-3 hour segments before the bugs drag my cities down and the memory of $60 leaving my bank account returns to my brain.  There's a patch coming tomorrow, but I expect even 6 months from now this review will read much the same.  Highways turn into parking lots, budgets turn into nightmares, and you realize that EA has a long way to go before this game is worth purchasing when all the power and water your neighbor is giving you disappears when the server fails to sync.I did manage to get the Sims 3 out of this purchase after quite a lot of frustration, so that's a +1 star right there.  What's bad about Simcity is the issues it has were so easy to see coming that I don't know why I keep pre-ordering EA products.  Simcity 4 had traffic problems but not so bad that your city literally came to a halt.  The lack of real estate for building cities is something I expect to be solved eventually, so I will give EA the benefit of the doubt on that.  As for the lack of subways, atrocious highway design, no custom terrain, and the sheer number of game breaking bugs too numerous to list, I don't know how EA didn't delay this game a month to save their reputation even if it damaged sales.It looks great and plays great when it is working.  Beautiful game.  I never wanted a refund even when I couldn't access the game at the beginning.  The primary reason I advise against buying this game for anything more than $10-$20 is because when your city is aflame, covered in garbage, and has an impending disaster about to hit your last chance at balancing the budget, you'll wish you could say, &#34;wow, I did that!&#34;  Instead, you find yourself zooming in on that single blocked mass transit bus that strangled your city to death and wonderwhat piece of code caused that catastrophe.There is nothing more comical and sad than watching a robber stuck in traffic for 6 hours while the police car behind it waits patiently in traffic, sirens blaring, only for the criminal to get away by pulling into his driveway.EA does have a history of patching and patching, so here's hoping they patch this into the game we all expected.  I'm tired of being unable to share resources between my own cities when that was kinda the whole point.",

I will NEVER be a customer of EA again so the CEO and his little group of followers can drive their Lamborghinis.",

If you are those people who saw the first trailer about two cities polluting each other and needs to build a nuclear plant in the middle between the two cities, this is nothing like the trailer. You can not joint build a nuclear plant but you may build a solar farm in middle of nowhere on the map but I doubt anyone will play that far into the game and yet to see it do anything. By the time you get to build that, most of the map are abandon because map too small and everyone finish buidling their cities and left.They can really improve the game by making bigger city and closer cities together so you actually dont feel so lonely on the map. Most of time I feel like Im playing online but there is no interaction in the whole map because everyone can be self dependent so easily they just finish building and abandon. Also why isnt there any subway?Another ripe is the high cost of add ons. It feels like paying 60 bucks for a game is not enough and they want you to pay more for add ons. I will definitely go back and play sim city 4",

        "body": "Ok, you're going to see a lot of terrible reviews for this game, but I simply ask you to ignore them.  They're written by self-entitled 12-year-olds that have nothing to do but cry about the changes in the game that they don't like.  They can get over it, honestly; this game isn't that bad.  Most of them are even copy and pasting each other's complaints because they don't want to seem ignorant - when we all know they are anyway.So, here's the deal:The game is completely online which is GREAT when it's actually available - as you may know, like any other game that functions completely online(LoL and WoW coming to mind) sometimes it is unavailable due to server saturation.  The problem is that people don't know a damn thing about how that process works and just expect it to, when it's a lot more complicated than they think.  While this game did have server problems, as of today most of them have been dealt with and people who have bought the game are also receiving a free copy of an EA game to compensate for the issues.The city sizes are small for two reasons:  Increases the amount of attention you pay to one area and because some people wouldn't be able to run larger cities on their current computers. People list this as a bad thing, of course, but it isn't at all.  Sure, you can't build endlessly in one slot anymore, but that's not what this specific game is about.  It's all about extreme micro-managing combined with community participation.  The WHOLE point of the game is to build multiple cities and have them thrive by running off of each other.  To go even further, the fun of it comes from OTHER PEOPLE who join your game so that you can work together and supply each other in areas that you're weak in.  A lot of people are trying to play this game by themselves, and that's simply not how it's meant to be played.Another thing that people are complaining about and shouldn't be is how long it takes to develop a city.  Since when do people care that it takes a small amount of time to do something in a video game?  Like, OMG I can build a whole city in 5 hours what a rip off.  I mean, come on...seriously?  You're complaining that you can technically play through a game in five hours while still having fun?  I don't get it.  Some of us have things to do outside of spending 13 hours a day playing SimCity and if that's you, then this isn't the game for you at all.  I'm not saying you can't play the game for that long, as in any SimCity problems will always arise that need your attention.  But, again, that isn't what this game is about.  The whole idea behind the cloud system is that you can play it in micro bursts anywhere that has an internet connection.  Not to mention, building one city doesn't mean you're done.  As I said before, that isn't the point.  This game is focused on you building multiple cities that mutually contribute to each other in order to have the best region in the game - yes, there are leaderboards for a reason.Anyway, those are some of the biggest complaints.  This game doesn't suck, it's just different from other SimCity titles in that their focus was placed somewhere else.  I've thoroughly enjoyed it since I've bought it and have even suggested it to friends who are enjoying themselves with it as well.  Don't listen to these sarcastic fools crying about the changes in the game, buy it and check it out for yourself.",

        "body": "Let me start by saying the graphics are very good.  I love building my cities with their specialties, but once you've built about 5 cities each with its own specialty you feel as though you've built everything in the game.  Keep in mind though that the multiplayer nature of regions should make the game fun to play over skype with friends, but the regions themselves have several blaring issues.  In the region I play with my friend we've attempted 3 great works, only the city initiating the great work seems to be able to interact and donate resources to it.  Now the great works may be just one part of the game, but it is the most important multiplayer component as it is something my cities and my friend's cities should be able to work on together for our region.  Other than talking in skype the multiplayer nature of the game includes sending money to each other and building our cities independently of each other with a pop up on occasion saying my police, or fire department is helping out his city or vice versa.  In other words the multiplayer nature of this game is a joke and I feel like we're playing two separate games with the option of looking at his city.I would give the game 4-5 stars if the following were true-It allowed you to build a single city with a friend (ie two mayors) it would be difficult to build a city but it would be an interesting option to try.- The great works actually allowed for us to have multiple cities donate to them (some people experience this problem others do not, I am experiencing this problem).- The cities were larger (while the small cities themselves aren't a deal breaker I find as the density increases I have no room to expand essential infrastructure, waste, water, power, etc.)- Had a subway system (this game is perfect for a subway system, since land is so valuable why not implement an underground transportation solution?)- Had a farming city specialty (This would be an awesome addition,you cover freight 'generic', computers, tv's, alloy, plastics, etc. why not food?)  I would love to build a farming city in this game and it makes sense to have food for your Sims right?",

This discussion, though important, has served as a distraction from a very real problem.The game is broken.The advanced algorithms that direct and track traffic throughout your city and region simply do not work. Traffic takes illogical and often flat-out incorrect routes for no apparent reasons. Traffic will cause a traffic jam while trying to take a two-lane dirt road, completely ignoring a wide open, double-wide avenue that is only slightly less convenient. With logic like this you simply cannot properly manage traffic.It gets worse. Traffic does not only include cars. SimCity treats all resources, services, citizens, and mass transit as traffic. Schools are not able service their areas because students are treated as traffic and subject to the same faulty logic.Police and fire coverage are treated as traffic. Garbage services are traffic.Electricity and water are traffic.And the same faulty logic hobbles each and every one of these aspects of city planning.SimCity is broken, possibly beyond repair. The discussions of online play are clouding the real issue, and until this underlying element of play is fixed, the game should be avoided at all costs.",

        "body": "I bought 2 copies of this so my brother and I, who live in the same house, could play together.  We were excited with the fact that we could finally play a Sim City game with each other and with other people.Being that it is an EA game though, I should have known that if I wanted the true experience of the game, I should have re-mortgaged my house, prayed to the heavens that EA's servers would actually work, and wait for the alignment of the moon, sun, galaxy, and outlying universe to actually try playing the game.Since installing, it has been nothing but a big headache.  Every time I launch it, I am forced to go through the tutorial before I can try playing the game myself.  This is extremely annoying.  I have tried numerous times to create a game so my brother and I could play and have received errors numerous times about &#34;try again later&#34;.  We finally got a new game going and he and I were almost happy.  We were building our cities and going along fine until we got booted.  After logging in again, the data was lost and I had to do the tutorial yet again.Then there is the constant advertising about upgrading to the Deluxe Edition and how much content I am missing out on.  I get that they want to make money, they are a business after all, but when I tell you no, don't bug me about it every 5 minutes.If I could return this product, I would.  I absolutely hate it.  I used to love the Sim City franchise, but EA has bastardized it and taken all the fun out of it.",

Thanks for taking this disaster off my hands Amazon!Update:  After the GM of Maxis came out on Friday and said that they fixed their server issues and added a new server and many more users could be accommodated, I thought I would try again.  Four days and I still have not successfully connected.  Yesterday, the 'game' just sat and spun its wheels literally all day. Most recently this morning I get this error:  'ERROR CODE SMCY-19: Could not communicate with the SimCity update server. Please see the customer support link for help.'  When I click on the 'Learn More' link, it takes me to a webpage that says:  'An error occurred!' in 48 point font.  LOL. Yes, yes, it did.Thanks Maxis and Origin!

The graphics look good, but with poor server connections not being available 45%  of the time, it's a waste of money. It is like putting a Mercury Engine into an old Ford Pinto. Same with this, primitive server technology and a good game do not work well together. This game should have had an off line option.

Again, EA provides NO documentation re the features.A negative--whenever you boot up your PC, the software shortcut auto-loads at bottom of the screen which slows my pc boot up time.Lots of fun. but make sure you have a watch handy--the system does not show real time as you play!",

Three of us excitedly got back from work and tried to add each other as friends. But the servers were buggy and full of errors. Servers told us it couldn't create cities for us to play in. We were all online and Friends on Origin but within the game, none of us could see each other or join each other's games.Once we were finally able to create one after a stroke of luck, we were told our cities were lost in the server. When we joined another server hoping it would work, we were greeted as if we never had played the game. The tutorial played again, and the region our city was in was completely gone.So... We couldn't play the game. We couldn't save the cities. We couldn't join each other's game. But, EA could verify that we were a paying customer.What did I pay $60 for again? That's right, I paid $60 that EA execs think they are entitled to without giving customers a working product. I paid $60 to the EA execs so I could be treated like a criminal under EA's constant-online DRM.EA already had a blowback like this with Spore. I'm speechless how these executives get paid millions to produce disasters like this. Speechless.Amazon, I hope you can refund my $60.

        "body": "I really enjoy this game. You cannot judge a game like this within the first few days and be able to really do it justice. The reason is this: It is an online game. No matter how much beta testing you have to try to crash the servers, on that first day it will always crash. it has for other big name games (Diablo III anyone). After a few days, it gets solved.Here are my thoughts about the game:Pros:1. I get to play with my fiance. We won't play at the same time BUT when I'm not playing, he can play in the same region and help MY city while he plays instead of him playing my city and screwing it up (he does that often)2. I get to focus on the quality of my city instead of trying to fill out my city and having a lot of run down parts. Right now I have half my city full and it is thriving and growing very quickly which is VERY exciting!3. The new updates to the game are GREAT. I love how I can just click update road and update the section of road I want. No more having to go and draw new lines, get rid of established places, etc. This is amazing.4. I love the objectives. I feel bad when I don't get them BUT I really enjoy the achievements and objectives.5. Being able to help the people of the city. I love being able to prepare for fireworks or block parties. I also enjoy seeing their thoughts and helping them!6. their smile faces. When I add something good, their faces go up and they become happy.Cons:1. Always online. I'm not the biggest fan of that. Due to it, I had to wait 2 hours until my game was fully updated last night.2. Subways. I do miss the subways but I understand due to the map size it really wouldn't be possible.3. complaints being a little vague. I had a protest at my city hall due to not collecting trash. I added more trucks and dumps and it still didn't fix it. I wish they would tell me exactly how to do that.I do not have many cons. I played for about 3+ hours last night and I had no problems with the game. I had fun the entire time. I think this is a good base for the game and it will continue to evolve with updates and DLC.",

        "body": "I would not recommend getting the box version. They ship you a CD which contains the Origin installer. Once you install Origin, Origin updates. After Origin restarts, you can download your game. Once you download the game, the game has to update multiple times with a reboot after each time. Finally, if you are trying to play at peak hours, you can't you get placed in a queue. However, when the timer on the queue expires, you just get placed back on the end of it.Overall, it takes way too long to actually start playing the game, and installing from a CD won't help any.I ended up logging into the European servers because they were the only ones working.Once you do finally play, the game is pretty decent. Traffic can be a little silly. And if region play is disabled, you can forget about getting above 200k sims in a city or building a great work.Generally, I had fun, but am not in love. With the $20 discount for pre-releases on amazon, I'd say it was worth it.",

The original update took about 20 minutes (a little long considering the game was just released) however, since then I have not experienced any major issues since then.  As of today (3/12/13) there are about 20 servers up and running at Origin and I have not had issues getting on any of them.  I really wish EA/Maxis/Origin had done a better job at launch, this game had so much great buzz around it, they had to have been able to anticipate that the servers would be overloaded at launch - unaccpetable.  I read everyone elses frustrations before purchasing my copy...and almost didn't.  That being said, now that some of dust has settled and people might actually be able to start playing I hope that they can enjoy the game as much as I am.  It truly is the best Sim City to date.  So many wonderful features and add on's from the fourth version.  The ability to totally control your city is so wonderful and the gameplay and graphics are smooth and simply beautiful. I love this series and have played every version.  I really hope that EA/Maxis/Origin takes a long look at what happened here.  They took a wonderful product and created a horrible stigma around it that is not going to go away anytime soon.",

        "body": "UPDATE: With over a month into the game and the latest 2.0 patch, I have to report that it is still largely unplayable in most forms. The only way you can effectively play is either with a single city by yourself, or if your neighbors are located in distant corners of the region. The massive issues of traffic and trade will grind any city to a halt, and with no undo button or ability to save your game your city can literally self destruct beyond repair. The patches have fixed some problems, but major problems remain and it will still be a few months I think before the game becomes truly playable for long lengths of time.Original Review:Hello and thank you for reading my review. This is a review of the actual game, and not a rant about DRM, there are hundreds of other reviews covering that already.First is the issue of the state of the game right now, it is near unplayable due to the EA servers being completely unstable. If/when that gets resolved I'll be back to update this review and give it another star (making it a 3 star game).So, besides server connection issues, how is the game? Honestly there is a lot of good in the game ... but also a lot of bad unfortunately.What I like about the game is the updated look and vastly better camera control. You can zoom in really close, rotate the camera to any angle, and tilt the camera as well. This gives you a much better look at your city.I really like that you can build roads in almost any shape, gone are the days you are forced to make straight lines or a jagged diagonal. They've also streamlined some of the mundane aspects of the game like power lines and water pipes, these are all automatically handled by the roads. Speaking of roads, they can now be upgraded and they are actually what determines the zone density. A light road will only have a single lane each direction and will allow low density housing, but if you want medium density you can just upgrade the road to a 2 lane each direction road (4 total) and your houses/commercial/industry can upgrade into medium density. No need to delete roads, no need to bulldoze neighborhoods to re-zone.Another aspect I'm really enjoying is services buildings can be upgraded as well. You can increase the capacity of hospitals, schools, police stations, etc. A nice touch is these services also send out individual vehicles to do their job, it's not just behind the scenes number crunching. You can actually see school buses going out to pick up kids, fire fighters putting out blazes in buildings, and police chasing criminals.So now for the bad, what I don't like. First of all the most obvious is city sizes are dramatically smaller. You can still make a large-ish city population wise (around 250k people) but physical size is very small. You can have multiple cities per region, like in SC4, but they are spread out by large spaces and it's a bit unrealistic to have open fields and forests then in a perfect square you suddenly hit wall to wall skyscrapers.Another issue I have is a lot of building types have been removed, for example power plant options and transportation options. Want a subway system? Sorry, doesn't exist. I have a feeling of dread that EA will come out with these later as paid DLC in fashions similar to The Sims ... very small expansion packs at very high cost, and in huge quantities making a complete game purchase cost into the hundreds of dollars. To be fair, their are some new building types that have not been seen in previous games, mainly the specializations (coal mines, ore mines, oil pumps, etc).I've also been running into quite a few bugs/glitches. One I see frequently is roads not being solid, sections will look like they are slightly under the ground rather than over it. A big problem I've encountered is the UI not loading the graphics or info cards. So for example if I go to place zome parks all the options are shown as a blank box and I have no idea what is what. They'll eventually show up if I wait long enough making me wonder if it has something to do with the constant internet connection required and the servers constantly going down.Multiplayer, the supposed reason for constant online, is more miss than hit. Within a region you can have other people controlling the other cities and these players can trade services and resources. For example if one city has more than enough fire coverage they can loan out their extra fire trucks to another city. Or a coal mining city can provide coal to another city to use as power. The problem with all this is it relies on those people actually being there and working on their cities... if you open up a public game, get some players, then 20 minutes later they disappear you loose all the benefits and you probably will never see those people again. This feature is really only useful if you play only with real life friends, and they all make a commitment to play the game regularly.Overall i think the game can have some fun to it, provided the servers are working, but they've also removed a lot of options and I can't shake that feeling of dread that they are coming via micro-transactions and/or insanely high priced 'expansions' akin to The Sims.tions are shown as a blank box and I have no idea what is what.

It is clear now that this was simply a veneer added as an excuse to try to sell the always-online DRM.It is just beyond frustrating to only want to play the game solo and find that one can't play, despite having the game in hand, because no multiplayer server is available for solo play.

EA foolishly did this to prevent piracy, however, everyone I know is going to pirate the game because of the the DRM.Wait until there is an online version of this game, then it will be worth $60 easy.",

        "body": "It's hard to believe that in this day and age of technology we still have to deal with garbage like this.EA has made many mistakes over the years, but this game takes the cake.The start of the problems as far as I am concerned was when they set up a pre-order without allowing people to pre-download the game files. So opening day you have thousands of people trying to not only download the game files, but trying to create cities.Second to that was forcing EVERYONE who wants to play (including those that purchased copies on disc) to create an Origin account. Its also worth noting that this game requires an internet connection to play! What's that mean for those that live in areas that have spotty internet, or can't afford broad band? It means this game is not for you, so don't buy it.The next problem is leaving thousands of people in the dark about what exactly is going on as the servers are constantly going down, and when they're up you constantly get booted and it doesn't save your game... The staff at EA were replying on the forums only to the few compliments that were there, and ignoring the slew of complaints, save for the few people that had their posts deleted due to vulgar language (Who can blame them?!).The icing on the cake is the 300+ min wait time to talk to someone in tech support via chat, and god only knows how many hours the wait time is on the phone.I wish I could review the actual game itself, but unfortunately it doesn't work!",

When I bought this game I figured I would need internet to install it, this is EA we're talking about after all(Pshh). I didn't, however, expect to need CONSTANT internet connectivity to run MY ALREADY PURCHASED GAME. So thanks again, EA for boning me, exploiting my money & time, & most of all for sucking all the money you can out of your faithful consumers. I'm sure the rest of the now angry-fan-mob can agree with me. Thank you. Thank you very much.P.S. I feel as though all the 5 star reviews are utter BS scrapped together by the developers or publishers in some hopeless attempt to regain some ground in their F-ed up situation. Let me just remind you EA, you're not on the ground anymore. You're floating in the clouds somewhere with your heads up each others asses. You should all go back to flipping burgers at McDougals. DRM is a joke. & you're a joke.",

It is now a 100% multiplayer game. This means your save file is really not your save file, it belongs to EA.One thing I loved doing in prior games is going onto Sim City forums and downloading game saves from people who had created amazing cities... usually so I could destroy them... but the point was that they were able to share their work with other people. Thats no longer possible.Another thing is that this is EA we are talking about here... once Sim City stops selling in a couple years, they will turn off the servers and move them to work on a new game. Anything you have saved at that point will be gone completely and forever. This software purchase is more of a software rental.Don't support this.",

And their servers have been pretty much constantly down since the game was released.If you are lucky enough to actually get the game to launch, you MIGHT get 10 minutes of game time to start building your city, but the second your internet connection to the crappy EA servers goes out, you get kicked out of the game and lose all of your work.Yes, truly, I have not been able to play the game enough to fully review the gameplay, but in my view there is no way to remove the quality of the customer experience from the overall product. And as far as that goes, it does not get much worse than 'I payed $60 for this and I can't even use it.'",

(Bought on 3/22/2013)Pros:- quick to load- Private mode so you can build a huge cities on a region.- create or join a game (again this can be set to private which is awesome!)- you get a free game! I got mass effect 3. You can choose from battlefield 3, dead space 3, mass effect 3, bejeweled and a few others.- highly addicting(could be a com as well)- sandbox mode (cheat mode)- automatically saves- no server issues!Cons:- Highly addictive- constant online connection. If your connection hiccups, you have a chance of losing progress.This might be a pro or con:- always need to connect to origin. I've used origin for the sims 3, and personally, I uninstalled it because it always froze while updating, and it was just a horrible experience. But origin must have been updated or something (I'm a bit behind :p) because the interface is so much nicer, and it doesn't slow down my computer anymore. Also you can use the origin web browser and other features while in-game, so you don't have to alt-tab out!Final though: I had trouble deciding if this game was worth it, but I am definitely glad I bought it. I highly recommend this game. Also the city specialization definitely adds a lot more strategy to the game, but you will have to see for yourself :)",
