        "body": "Fun game.After hours spent playing i feel i have a good understanding of the game its very fun to play especially with friends.Several of my friends got the demo of destiny which is very extensive for a demo and if you have the demo you can play with people with the full game so since i bought the full game i could play with my friends who had the demo.Anyways the story of destiny isnt quite there most of the time i spent playing i dident know what i was doing except go here kill these people repeat then fight a boss then listen to my compaion kinda sorta explain what i was doing there in 30 seconds thats basiclly the whole story with the occasional cutscene if your looking for a in deapth story you wont find it here.Now on to the gameplay the game play is a blast! i love different guns and the ability to change guns in the middle of battle.i love the different enemy's it gives that mmo feel in a fps overall its fun i personally really liked it.The online features are very nice as well you have the ability to do campaign missions with 2 other friends (max of 3 people) then theres the PVP which is pretty fun it is pretty challenging and if you do get the game i would reccomend not playing the PVP till you a high lvl since most of the people on PVP are lvl 30. Overall i think this is a pretty fun game i would reccomend buying if you dont really care about the story, like FPS,have friends who have the game,if you can find the game cheapStory: 3/10Gameplay: 8/10Online features (PVP,co-op story,etc): 7/10",

When I played it, I realized I couldn't have been more wrong.Destiny is an incredible experience. Is it perfect? Far from it. Little technical problems are found throughout the game. But, one thing the game has in no short supply is FUN. Crucible is a ton of fun, and there are rarely any connectivity issues. If there are, it's probably because the player's WiFi needs rebooted.The story isn't particularly deep, but it doesn't need to be. The worlds are huge and tons of fun to explore, even if you can't go everywhere that you can see.The only thing the game has an utter lack of is players with headsets, but that's not Bungie's fault.I highly recommend Destiny, as it is a ton of fun, and has something for everyone.",

The Raids are an awesome way to get together with 5 good buddies and see what kind of damage 6 high level guardians can do against the alien forces pressing against the human race. While there are few cut scenes and the story is not well animated, this game is much more than just another FPS. This is a game with tons of room for growth as Bungie has already began making updates to the way we play this game. Game of the year 2014!",

        "title": "No story, Extremely repetitive.  Tries to be a FPS, MMO, and RPG, and fails at being anything more than mediocre.",
        "body": "Truth be told, aside from the graphics, this game is probably pretty bad.  The worst part about it, you have to always be online.  If you lose connection, you get booted.  Typically this isn't a problem, but the Destiny servers can be temperamental at times, which leads to being booted repeatedly and given a zoos worth of error codes (bee, boar, etc).Campaign (PvE)In the campaign mode there is almost no story whatsoever.  You can chose from 3 races when you build your character, and as you play you will fight against 4 more races of creatures.  The problem is, that at no point does the game explain how any of these races are connected.  If you're looking for a story based game, you're looking in the wrong spot.  There are approximately 6-8 story missions per celestial body, but you only need to play 3 or 4 of them to advance the &#34;story&#34;, what little story there is, and the others just seem to be fillers.  In addition to these missions there are 1 or 2 strikes per location and one raid.  (DLC adds more).The loot system on this game is horrible, almost inexplicably so.  Once you beat the story mode you are left to complete bounties (do this mission, kill this many people, do 6 patrol missions on X), as well as the daily, weekly and nightfall missions.  The daily is just replaying one of the previous missions, but on a higher difficulty level.  The weekly and nightfall are replaying a strike on a higher difficulty level.  To say that this game gets repetitive is an understatement.  You'll just find yourself continually doing the same few missions and strikes over and over againFor most missions you can only have fireteams of three, but for Raids you can have six people on your fireteam.  Unlike strikes, in which the game will match people with you, the Raids will not.  So you have to find five other people who are willing to spend the 3-5 hours it takes to complete the raid.  Often times this has people going on Redditor similar sites to meet up.  I'm not sure why the game developers didn't allow for matchmaking for the raids.Multiplayer (PvP)It isn't a terrible multiplayer, but that's probably the best thing that I can say about it.  It's ok.  There are the usual type of matches to play, but nothing special about any of it.  I've played it because it is in the game and it can be helpful to level up, but overall, it isn't a terribly enjoyable experience.  I seem to play the same 2-3 maps constantly.  There is no ability to vote on maps or any other add-ons that are typical with most multiplayer FPS games.Conclusion:The game becomes insanely repetitive rather quickly.  It is just a constant grind to try and get new gear and level it up, before DLC is released and it all starts over again.  The game limits the amount of Vanguard and Crucible marks, which are used as currency.  They are limited to the number you can gain per week (100) and a total you can have at one time (200).  This has a feeling of, we want you to have fun, but on our terms.  If you level up too quickly, you'll stop playing the game, and we won't be able to sell you more DLC.  With the first DLC a new layer the Vanguard and Crucible Commendation were added. to slow down leveling up gear even more.  The game becomes frustratingly annoying.Destiny tries to be too many things to too many people.  It's an MMO, an RPG, a FPS...the only problem is, that it doesn't do any of those things very well.  But, the graphics look great, so that's something.  I feel like I got ripped off buying this game.  There is only 1/4 of a story and very few missions and strikes.  Now if I want more, I have to pay another $20.  No thanks, I'll cut my losses and find something else.",

Probably less if you really tried to rush it. There is about 18 levels, most only 10 minutes or so in length.Story and &#34;characters&#34; are horrible. You can not skip cutscenes, and are forced to rewatch them over and over if you dare replay a level (and you'll be replaying a lot of levels as that is the only end game.)6 strikes which you will complete a dozen times over before getting so bored with the repetitiveness that you quit.Competitive is 6 maps (lol) and 4 modes (lol) and are all dull and uninspired. 2 vehicles, a bike and a tank, in 2 of the 6 maps.There are NO rewards or loot to even speak of. The only legendaries come from weeks and weeks of grinding reputation and then buying.Just save your money and buy something else. The game is awful.",

Destiny has a couple of things I really like: the customizing of your character and gear and the high level of difficulty.  The story levels are actually pretty easy for me (as well as the patrol missions), but the Firestorm co-op levels are a lot tougher, and those are the missions where I really enjoy playing the game.The music is amazing!  Control is great!Note: you MUST be online and connected to PSN to play the game.  I did get bumped offline once (not from my end) but I picked up where I left off no problem, losing only a bit of the patrol mission I was currently engaged in.I recommend it for anyone who owns a PS3, even if this isn't their usual genre.",

The game, as is, will turn off a lot of people; especially some that had such huge hopes and expectations for the game.  The game does lack story, and seems to throw that back in your face with refusing to explain about anything.  You'll realize this when watching a couple of the few cut scenes that appear.  I also found customization to be somewhat lacking, and the in-game economy could use some refinement.  What do you use actual money (called glimmer) for?  Mostly to buy things that don't matter, consumables, engrams (they are like a grab bag for a particular item, which doesn't quite guarantee you get what you are looking for), and crummy gear and weapons. They have a special vendor that sells the best weapons and armor for currencies called strange coins and motes of light; and you can get them doing some activities and by other means, but no real effective way to earn them (except for weekly strike missions for the strange coins, if you're good or strong enough).  Where this game shines right now is with it's game play.  On the most part, I'd say it plays fast, loose, and smooth.  PvP is where you'll find the most of your replay value, but they'll need more modes and maps to keep some interested.  PvE is incredibly repetitive, but hopefully they add more rewards for doing the same mundane tasks over and over again and/or improve this area of the game in upcoming expansions and patches.  In the end, this game has huge promise, great controls and game play mechanics.  This is a game that will evolve over time, and I pray and hope Bungie and Activision don't muck up the evolution like they did the launch.",

You're just doing it in hopes of getting some loot. Moreover, you will probably spend days upon days running around mars collecting relic iron (or worse filaments on the moon) until you're numb. That is probably the most unfun part of the game.And I guess &#34;numb&#34; is a pretty fitting description of how I feel about Destiny. The game's gear grind is numbing. It's lack of story is numbing (really, there IS NO story whatsoever). It's lack of any type of traditional mmo in-game social tools like a chat channel makes the game, though pretty graphically, numbing and isolating.Pass on this addiction.

        "body": "Destiny is one of those games where graphics and detail can astound you, if you have a PS4 or XBone. Don't expect much on the 360 as they had to downgrade quality a lot for the outdated hardware to run it. It's not Bungie/Activision's fault for that since it was necessary.But graphics don't compensate for gameplay. Something that looks nice but doesn't operate for the first year or so *coughcoughBattlefield4coughcough* isn't worth the money. So is the Destiny gameplay worth it? Yes and no. The structure of missions, side missions, Strike missions, Raids, the Crucible, and Patrol adds a lot of fun and challenge.You have a short storyline that investigates a new enemy across different planets and celestial bodies. You have Strike missions that have a very specific objective to accomplish, rewarding you with a point and experience system that can be used towards Vanguard rewards. Raids are high-difficulty challenges that require a lot of teamwork and strategy but in return give you unique armor, weapons, and accessories that would otherwise take weeks to get through chance of random items dropped by enemies. The Crucible is a PvP arena with a handful of different modes. Within the Crucible you'll also earn XP towards a character and acquire points and experience that can be used towards goods, much like the Vanguard system.Destiny falls short in many ways, primarily through the lack of content. Each player can create up to three characters of different classes which have unique skills and stats. You can trade items between your characters and store away what you can't use or can't carry. You cannot trade with other players. But what is there to trade? Your character has three weapon slots that ironically decrease by one each category of weapons: Primary, Secondary, and Heavy. There are only 4 types of Primary weapons (Auto rifle, 3-round burst, semi-auto, Magnum revolver), 3 secondary (Sniper, Shotgun, Fusion), and two heavy (Rocket launcher, Machine gun). That's it. While each has randomized stats and upgrades you're restricted to what it is preset to. You can upgrade damage, the sight, and features that improve one stat at the penalty of another but this is *if* it features it.Your character can collect armor with different appearances but the collection of such is very, very small. More often than not you'll create a collection of duplicate items from random drops after killing enemies. There are a few color schemes you can apply to a character if you find or purchase it but the NPC that sells colors has very little variety. In fact you can expect 4 or more colors to stay in stock with the others cycled out each week. Hunter class has cloaks, Titan class has a type of waistband flag, and the Warlock has an armband. You can't see the Warlock armband half the time because of how small it is, the Titan waist-flag rests on one side of the hip (right side only), and Hunter class gets cloaks. If anything the Hunter class is most despised since the cloaks are much more noticeable and artistic.You can purchase/find ships for different designs but that's it. It doesn't affect gameplay and you can only see it in orbit when meeting up with a team. You have a land vehicle similar in purpose to an ATV called a &#34;Sparrow.&#34; You can buy them in tiers with better speed and durability but that only helps to get you from point A to point B.The whole system is very &#34;grindy,&#34; meaning the ways of earning special weapons and improving stats requires repeating the same missions over and over and over in hopes of stumbling across better gear. A primary weapon via Vanguard missions/Crucible games costs 150 marks: you are limited to earning 100 marks per week for each but you're given 2-6 per session. Finding items as drops means killing the same enemies over and over but even if you get the high-tier &#34;engrams&#34; (containers that must be opened by an NPC to reveal the actual item) you're more likely to get upgrade materials instead of actual armor/weapons. The only way to ensure worthwhile drops is by Raids that one character can complete only once per week.Classes are also unbalanced as experienced in PvP. Worse than that, the lag that can be experienced will sometimes delay your respawn by double or triple the time it would normally take. But it won't be just you, you'll be joined by other players who are banging their heads against the wall.The most annoying, in my opinion, is the leveling system. Your character caps at level 20 which can be achieved over a weekend. From there you have to improve your armor by finding pieces with more &#34;light.&#34; The more light they hold, the higher your &#34;light&#34; level goes (21-32). Extra experience earned after level 20 is collected and turned into a &#34;Mote of Light,&#34; a useless currency for terrible class rewards (waistband, cloak, armband) that don't match color schemes and in some cases look downright terrible. The best part? The rewards are the same for everyone and cycled out after a lengthy period of time. If there was an option to apply these to armor to increase light it would at least server a worthwhile purpose.So, is Destiny worth it? If you like replaying missions numerous times with friends just to get armor with slightly better stats, yes. If you like the challenges given by relentless raids on enemy homeworlds and weekly missions that have a modified difficulty and conditions, yes. If you like Halo PvP with a twist, yes. If you want a wide variety of classes and subclasses to experience, no. If you want cool, unique weapons as rewards, no.

The game is short without paying an extra $60 for the DLC, the multiplayer is a halo clone, and the &#34;open-world&#34; is made up of separated areas with invisible walls everywhere and a pretty sky-box.  I've played this game for over 200hrs and had very little fun. Since, I've picked up Elder Scrolls Online which is a much more comprehensive MMO with an actual open-world, and a lot more activities in said open-world.  The classes are Enforcer (supposed to be a tank hence the armor) which ends up being a support class. Hunter (the rouge) It's as advertised. Last but not least is warlock (wizard,sorcerer), this one is the tank/dps/everything so its basically OP. This is confirmed by even bungie, there is a challange for one of the legendary weapons in the game that allocates points to kills on specific classes, the warlock is worth 5 more points than the other classes.  In the first-person shooter aspect it's a re-skinned halo. I've played a lot of halo as well. Basic kill is a few shots due to shields, It's very formulaic  Save yourself the wasted time and buy something else. Do not support this kind of game development.",

It's sort of like a FPS version of Diablo 3 except the 'dungeons' aren't random.Also, Bungie does listen to their fans and critics.

You have a choice to choose between three warriors, Warlock, Hunter, and Titan.

Plus 500 million dollar budget on this poor quality game. Its not even fun when you're playing with other people. The only good thing about the game is the music and visuals. I did not find this fun because I had experience playing other MMOs. I think a lot of people enjoy this game because its their first MMO, and they don't have anything to compare Destiny to other relate able MMO games. That's completely understandable and hey if you have fun then that's cool.I recommend this game to people who never played a MMO, who don't care about story, or a serious bungie fan. But if you're like me that craves a good story in games and have experience playing MMOs then this game is not for you.",

There have been plenty of writers/bloggers/reviewers who were able to communicate the story issue much better than I.  Frankly I would give the game five stars if it had a better story.  Some people have noted that Borderlands does loot better, Halo combat better, and just about any MMO the story better.  Yet almost everyone who has reviewed this game has noted the same thing that I will.  You can't help but keep coming back.I hope Bungie will be faster with the content updates because as of right now I am fine rehashing the same things but I don't know how much longer that will last.  With new games coming out soon and old games still calling to be played/finished I don't know if I will be sticking with the same set of strike/raid missions.",

I actually kept my expectations in check seeing the game was being a hyped a bit too much and yet I still was incredibly disappointed, This is easily my WORST video game purchase ever. I actually consider this a SCAM. I loved Halo games and have very fond memories so this is not me not liking Bungies works or style.  The game is so much lacking in content that I consider it a demo. Activision's greedy influence is very clear. There will be SO MUCH DLC planets, weapons, level increases, gear etc...no wonder the developer kept saying this will be 'supported'  for a long time and that not to trust 'first day reviews' .I mean I know I am sounding harsh but you have to play it to believe this. The 'story' which is ridiculously bad can be beaten in 5-6 hours and even then they were not fun, just same repetitive missions over and over. And once you reach the level 20...it's over there is nothing else to do. Not even getting better gear is worth it because the game balances pvp fights so you are never have the edge. I don't really know where the massive budget went. Oh wait I know...99% for marketing and 1% for the game content. I don't have much else to say to be honest. This game is a joke, not because it's bad but because there is barely a game in there, especially when you compare it to a game like Borderlands. I highly suggest you don't fall to the hype like I did. Stay away from this.",

The gear grind can be monotonous, but is ultimately rewarding in the end. The game's biggest strength is the challenge it presents, no matter if you're tackling a strike mission (group) with friends or strangers, or turning the difficulty up on solo missions, you will always find a challenge. The game works well with people who don't have many friends playing the game by using match making process to team you up with strangers to tackle harder objectives and I have yet to find a random group that didn't work well together and try to help each other.",

        "title": "An honest review from someone who has played and loved Bungie games for 20 years",
        "body": "Twenty years ago this December, I bought a new game for my second Mac at the local Microcenter and experienced something that changed the way I looked at games forever. Fun, addictive, action filled gaming centered in a universe rich with mystery and wrapped in a fascinating story and narrative. The small team that built it, Bungie, was clearly taking a different approach to game development. I eagerly lined up in successive years for the Marathon sequels, the Myth series (I and II, to this day my favorite action games of all time - read my original review of Myth II here from 1999 please pardon the typos: http://mythgraveyard.org/005967 ), and of course, Halo.When Halo was released it was the sole reason I bought an Xbox, and again it redefined my expectations for what gaming could, and should, be. Bungie's games, for me, have represented the pinnacle of gaming with four core elements:1) Rich stories, told through cutscenes and in-game context, that make you feel part of something 'bigger' than just the part you are playing as the main protagonist2) Addictive, satisfying gameplay and mechanics - what Bungie has described as '30 seconds of fun,' that occurs throughout the game3) Local or split-screen co-op, to easily play with your friends (and in my case now, family), in a single room4) Perhaps less important than the prior three, but still elemental to the experience, a compelling, orchestral musical score (for the most part done by Marty O'Donnell and Michael Salvatore)Measured on these four elements, I am sad to say that Destiny completely fails in all but one. The rich gameplay is here. Everything else is, for me, a disheartening failure.1) Story: As many of the reviews have pointed out, the Destiny story simply is not there. If it is, then it is far too difficult for most to discover it. In previous Bungie games, the story gives you purpose, engages you for a clear 'mission' to support it - and makes you part of that narrative. It created a sense of suspense and excitement for what is around the corner, and what you might expect from the next level. It gave you emotional engagement with characters - both your allies and your enemies, and put purpose behind their actions. It truly created a lore, of which you as the gamer were a part. Destiny's story does none of these things. Your actions and why you are doing them are rarely explained, they are disconnected, and it turns the story 'missions' into run-of-the-mill tasks in which you shoot forgettable enemies whose purpose are a complete mystery. I have finished the story and I'm still wondering what those guys wanted. This is a shame because as near as I can tell all of the pieces are there - they just haven't been used together to give it any meaning.2) Gameplay: Here, Destiny excels. It nails the '30 seconds of fun' - although you have to work hard at leveling up your character to experience it all, and hence at time it too feels like a chore. I actually enjoyed the leveling up process, and I will continue to play this game for months because it is truly fun (hence the five stars for 'how much fun is this game) - but it is really the game's only strong point - albeit the most important. A important side note on gameplay: It lacks any customizability from a gameplay standpoint. I have grown accustomed to being able to set things on 'easy' for my kids, crank up their health / shields, and let them run amok. My daughter, who has trouble with FPS mechanics and does not play them enough to become 'good' has found her limited time with the game frustrating because it is simply too hard for her to enjoy.3) Local Co-op: Here the game completely fails. With past Bungie games, especially Halo, I have been able to enjoy split screen or online private matches with my friends and my family. I am fortunate to have two xboxes, and I bought two copies of the game - but it means I need to put my daughter in one room, with me in another, and we are still subject to matchmaking for the strikes and PvP, vs. being able to set up a private match and explore the world together as we see fit. My wife loved this about Halo, and when we were younger we would play together in the evenings and even talk about our experiences over drinks at dinner the next night - but I doubt I'll ever get her to play a game of Destiny with me.4) Music: The music is solid but at the end of the day, forgettable. The opening orchestral theme is typical of O'Donnel's work, heavy with (what I believe are) 'E' chords and majestic melodies. The score that accompanies the gameplay is serviceable, but never anything special to make you feel like you you're an action hero in a movie.In sum, my take on Destiny is that it is a fun game to play and has a ton to offer, but it misses in so many areas that I've come to expect will be there in a modern game from this top-notch developer, that I cannot help but be disappointed.A final note: There is a TON of content in this game, with lots to do. To get the most out of it I suggest taking advantage of all of it. Don't plow through the story. Rather pick different activities, get bounties at the tower and work to accomplish them, try out the different weapons, powers, and character classes, and generally take your time with it. It IS fun - but just don't hope for it to have too much meaning other than the fun.Here's to hoping the next iteration fleshes the universe out some more, and the community's collective feedback makes it back to Jason Jones and the team at Bungie.Why no voting buttons?

Obviously the story isn't a large part of the game, but in all honesty i'm not that concerned about plot details in an online first person shooter. The planet design, the exotic bosses, it's all ridiculously fun.You should start the game doing the single-player campaign missions, level up (maybe do the missions on hard vs normal to get extra exp), build up weapons, make your way to the crucible, then begin doing STRIKES. Strikes are so, so so much fun. It's basically you spending 45 mins to an hour with random strangers, taking down a ridiculous boss on some far away planet. At the end of the mission, everyone winds up adding each other as friends. I cannot put this game down, very excited to keep building my character and checking out the new planets.",

        "body": "I was well aware of the reputation that this game has when I bought it for my new PS4, so I knew to temper my expectations. Now that I'm 40 hours into the game, I have to say that the criticisms that constantly get thrown at Destiny are well-founded. The missions are boring and repetitive. The story doesn't make a lick of sense. The environments, while pretty, are no fun to explore because they feel sterile and only contain constantly respawning enemies. The endgame leveling and loot system is... there.I've been told that the people who made Destiny were forced to scrap the original version of the game and re-do much of it in a hurry leading up to its release, and honestly I believe it. I was expecting something along the lines of first-person Mass Effect, in the sense that I would be travelling to different planets, going on adventures, meeting interesting characters, and playing fun missions, all in an epic sci-fi setting. In this regard Destiny does none of those things well at all.And yet, I cannot stop playing Destiny. I bought two other games along with my PS4; I've played Infamous for about an hour and I have yet to unwrap Shadow of Mordor. The fact is that the shooting in Destiny is flat-out fun despite the other serious flaws, and this keeps me coming back every single day.If you plan to play this game alone, then I have a very difficult time recommending it. The story missions are bad enough that I advise you to steer clear of Destiny if that's typically what the main draw  in video games is for you. The real fun is forming a fireteam with your friends and chatting while you play through the game in co-op mode. I'm not a fan of competitive multiplayer in general, but Destiny seems to do a pretty good job of it. If that's more your thing, then you'll probably have fun with it.Kudos to Amazon for price matching the game for me more than 2 weeks after I purchased it.",

        "body": "How many times have you ordered the 'special edition' of a game only to be disappointed upon the release???  That has happened to me more often than I would like to admit.  Destiny is a title that breaks this mold.  The 'Limited' edition of Destiny is truly a thing to be admired.  First of all, there is the case in which all the materials are enclosed.  when you take the slipcover off, you see the gorgeous artwork of the Limited Edition.  The Destiny logo is raised on the front cover and the spine.  The opening flap is held closed by an internal magnet.  Open the door, and you see the steel book edition of Destiny and the Journal style of other bonus items.  Let me just say right now, that the digital downloads alone are worth the upgrade to the Limited Edition.  You get the DLC up until next year.  The game disc is also enclosed in a very gorgeous steel book holder.  The booklet enclosed in the limited case is also very useful.  This details the weapons in Destiny, and describes all of the armory in the game.  I really like having a hard copy of this, because it allows me to compare the different weapons offline and determine which one would be best to have in my arsenal.  There are also some really cool post cards included from the different locations in Destiny.  Not sure I would ever really use these, but they are a very cool extra about the background of this game.  Destiny is truly an AWESOME game, and I feel it will make gaming history with its design and playability.  With the upcoming DLC, this seems to be a game that will continue to provide hours of entertainment far into the future.  I would greatly suggest spending the extra bucks for the Limited Edition.The Game Itself:I keep reading where people are comparing this to Halo and Borderlands. Having played both, I can see where the comparison could be true.  However, I think Destiny is better than either of those games.  These are the most beautiful graphics I've ever seen in any game.  As of this writing, I've only achieved Level 6, but even at this level there is a great array of weapons to choose from.  In Borderlands, you can't upgrade your weapon until you find the vending machine.  In Destiny, you are able to upgrade to another weapon at any time.  I also like how when you advance, and you no longer want some of the basic weapons, you can dismantle them anywhere in the game and receive credit.  Another thing that keeps this game from becoming boring or repetitive is the variety of environments in which you get to fight.  So far, I've only been to Earth, the Moon, and Venus.  There is a moment on the Moon where the big doors open, and a FLOOD of baddies come out and I simply thought, 'Oh S***!!!!!' .  The bosses in this are pretty tough, and that's where being online all the time really pays off.  I'm not a huge fan of online multiplayer, but this is cooperative gaming in the story mode.  You are pretty much on your own until someone crosses your path and may or may not decide to follow you.  I've revived other players in my solo quest, without it disrupting mine at all.  When you come up to one of the really bad A****, having other players in your world REALLY becomes a benefit.  I can't imagine being able to kill some of these without the help of co-op online players.  It really helps to create the feeling that you're in a real environment with other real people helping in your quest.  I'm really stoked for all of the other things that are in store for me in Destiny, and I plan to play this game for quite awhile.riting, I've only achieved Level 6, but even at this level there is a great array of weapons to choose from.

Which is a bit addictive. However IMHO addictive does not equal fun. The only replay value I've found is multi-player with friends, but once we moved on to new games we never looked back.The PVE content is exactly the same as the single player content with one (just one) exception. The vault of glass raid (VOG). VOG was awesome the first time I played it, great the second time.... OK the third. You get the pattern. This is game would improve monumentally if there were several raids similar to VOG. Unfortunately Bungie only released the game with a single raid giving it a pretty unfinished feel. The are releasing paid DLC adding a second raid soon. You won't see a review on that from me, because I have no plan to purchase the rest of the content that should have been released with the original game.Admittedly I'm not a big PVP fan in general. I've played my share of Battlefield and COD, but it always starts to feel pretty mindless and repetitive. Destiny PVP (AKA The Crucible) is pretty much the same. What makes it unbearable (IMHO) is that you can use single player skills that are a neat against overpowered bosses, and fun in large mobs, but a little unfair in a PVP environment. As an example, if you encounter just about anyone with their &#34;super&#34; charged they the encounter 9 times out of 10.In closing as I traded my version of destiny in for my xbox one it was hard to believe it came from the same company that brought Halo.",

The AI is horrible throughout the entire game. Most boss fights are nothing more than just a mob with a laughable amount of hp and you just duck behind something, wait for them to shoot, pop up and shoot them, then duck back down, and repeat this for 20 minutes.Don't believe the hype. And don't believe the talk about the expansions will make this game so much bigger and more complete. The expansions on the table add 1 strike, and 8 missions each, which is MAYBE about an hour of game play. If this game was 10 times bigger than it currently is it MIGHT be worth the money. But as it sits, even with the expansions your looking at $100 for a truly incomplete and poorly done game.",

Bungie is dedicated to continually improve this game, and add free content, so I know this game will improve with time. I would much rather have a game that runs good, and has less content, than one that crams in a bunch of content, but is filled with bugs (I'm looking at you DICE/BF4).There is still plenty of content, to enjoy with friends, but just not as much as Bungie had teased up, last year. It's been a month, and I'm still playing it daily.",

Destiny is a competent FPS with a beautiful yet empty environment. This is my biggest problem: I love great environments and exploring them. But Destiny's environments are mostly FPS type open environments and &#34;tunnels&#34; with a lot of invisible and visible walls, deadly drops and &#34;you die in 5 seconds if you don't turn around&#34; experiences. Want to explore this amazing moonscape, the intriguing martian city on the horizon or the eerie coast on venus - forget about it - they are pretty images - not landscapes. I played it - currently level 22 - I got my playtime for the money but I it was not particularly fun. Ok - 3 stars. BTW: a good story could have made this game 4 stars but there is no story ...",

I tried for over an hour. You can get people in party if you are able to talk to them first in game and find common ground. You can't do that on Destiny. You can just point, wave, dance, and sit down. Only get this game if you have a few friends who also have it and y'all are going to play it together. I feel so lonely on this game.

I play co-op with my friend and he likes it too. definitely a little dulled down on the scavenging and exploration aspects so instead I focus on precision killing enemies n such. if you have a little imagination in you you'll find it's not as awful as ppl review and provides a decent base for a potential series. if you play co-op with another friend maybe its more fun then sitting alone getting angry at a game :) peace n love friends",

This game has/had so much potential but Bungie has decided to rip the original game apart to sell the rest(which is already on disc but closed off to players) within highly over priced dlc &#34;expansions&#34;. The story is one of the worst in gaming to date. The laziness that went into this game is blatantly obvious. Once you finish the god awful story the rest of the game is nothing but the same exact story missions over and over and over. Each mission is basically the same. Go to location, deploy ghost so it can scan object, horde of enemies approach, kill them, end mission. The leveling system is based on armor obtained completely random throughout the game which holds &#34;light&#34;. You are constantly spending time upgrading this armor to reach a higher level, only for it to become obsolete in the next dlc,making all of the time you've put into the game pointless. Not to mention that if you do not buy the $20 dlc every 3 months, you will lose content you purchased with the original game. Aside for the shooting mechanics which are smooth, this is an absolutely horrible game. I would highly recommend you do not buy it.",

Ive enjoyed playing all of the halos and most of the call of dutys throughout the years but it seemed eventually the all had one flaw in common: repetition. You play thru the campaign on those games once or maybe a few more times if you really liked them but eventually, they got repetitive and you would just move on to multiplayer. Then, the same flaw after awhile strikes again, repetition. Games like that just werent meant to be played for that long and the companies knew it too, thats why they have to come out with a new game every year. But then, theres destiny. I was lucky enough to take part in the alpha and the beta when the full game was not released yet and i can truly say that justin playing the alpha and beta that this would be one of the best games to ever come out. I have completed the story already and played tons of mutiplayer and i just cant see this game getting boring anytime soon. The one thing i will say is the graphics in my opinion coupd have been a little better but other that that the game is absolutely flawless. I really love the interfaces bungie developed and unlike most of the call of dutys, multiplayer is flawless as well and the maps are brilliant. I know some people will disagree saying that this game was hyped up waayy too much but believe me when i say they are dead wrong. All you have to do is pick up a copy for yourself.

        "title": "Destiny a foiled attempt",
        "body": "I've been with bungie since their myth days, but with this release I just have to call it how it is. Destiny is a mess of game. One need look no further then the first few missions with the line &#34;I could tell you&#34; spoken by the lore master of the game. All the elements for a rich engaging story are set, but the execution is just terrible. I don't know if the all the fault lies with bungie, but certenly their attempt to move away from being a cash cow for Microsoft has landed them in a very similar situation with Activision. The story is told in quick 2 minute long conversations about some abstract war, that we are barely given time to understand, which we do not. Not even the grimoire, that you have to log onto with bungie.net, gives a very good description of the events, which could have made the this rich universe matter more to the player. Next presentation has center stage in this triple A title. The engine that bungie has designed for the game is simply beautiful, with lush colors and amazing texture. On PS4 and Xbox One destiny really shines as game, because of the next gwn systems prossenig power. Even on the eve of the PS3 and Xbos 360s retirement the game is breath taking. Thirdly the gameplay. The game play is spot on, there are very issues with it and for the most part it works as well as it looks. You've got your basic classes and abilities, tank, mage and marksman, and while they do differ a lot n terms of abilities, they can be played almost the same way. Mission structure is highly repetitive being blast your in and kill the boss, or its kill until you have enough objective items to continue. Also item ungrading is a grinding hassel that can take upwards of five hours of random loot drops and tediously long strike and raid missions. Multiplayer is eaxctly what one would expect of the modern FPS, and for the most part its very well rounded when your characters have surpassed level 20, because there is as of yet a skill level system that match'splayers with similar level players. Multiplayer for all intents and purposes is what keeps destiny from becoming a less the average game. However the most infuriating issue with destiny is the dlc locked on the game disic.  There have been so many confirmed reports of maps that are planned for future dlc locked into the base game. This one fact is the final nail in the destiny coffin for me. The seasonpass which runs for 35 dollars, is just to much of and asking price for content that should already be unlocked for people who shelled out the $50-60 for a have done game, and even then this content should now be available to fans for free, and any money should be refunded to those who have paided for the season pass. It is this type of business plan is what is suffocating the gaming matkets , and keeping people from loving console based gaming. Overall destiny is a game with amazing potential that was squandered, because publishing companies want to treat it as a cash cow rather than a work of art. Now, is there hope for the future? I'd like hope so. From the failure of destiny I pray that bungie is given more artistic control for the destiny franchise, and that Activision learns to treat the gaming industry with respect and learn from the mistakes of companies like Capcom and EA.",

        "body": "This is a must have game for PS4 players. I know it got a ton of hype, and in some ways does not live up to all it is built up to be, but it is a lot of fun. I am out of the norm for normal players in that I don't typically love the multiplayer aspect of video games. I find them annoying, and get fed up with the people on them quite quickly. This game is different. The multiplayer aspect only adds to the game. It lets you seamlessly go from single player to co-op at the drop of a hat without interrupting your gameplay. Or, you can enter a purely multiplayer match if you want. The graphics are gorgeous, and the controls just feel right. My only complaint is that it does get quite repetitive. There is not much variety in missions, and enemy spawning is insanely predictable. The story is not one in which you will get deeply involved, but it is fun non the less. I highly recommend Destiny for anyone looking for a beautiful game that is a lot of fun.",

        "title": "Fun with friends, but ultimately 'more of the same' that will struggle to keep your attention.",
        "body": "Having been an avid fan of all things Bungie, I was excited for this game, but the more I saw of early reviews, game footage and design, I started to get worried.  The key word going into every campaign I saw for Destiny was &#34;INNOVATION&#34;. But, that seems to be the most lacking element here. Now, let me say, as many have before - the game can be fun and inviting, but there is nothing here you have not seen before. Literally. The &#34;MMO&#34; aspects are elements you'll tinker with, but become bored with rather quickly. Upgrade this, adjust this... it's minimal effect click elements that begin to feel like more of a chore after only a few hours.The game itself is beautiful. It truly is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. But as many have pointed out, once you get past that, there really isn't anything else jumping out on that same level in the game.The Campaign - Fun, but terribly written and incredibly repetitive. Playing this solo wears thin in the first few hours.Multiplayer PvP &#34;The Crucible&#34; - Nothing new or original. In fact, this felt the most dated of all the elements in the game. There is sadly nothing new about the experiences you will have playing any multiplayer non-campaign elements.Multiplayer Campaign & Raids - This is the one area of the game that made me keep my copy and not sell it back to Amazon. Most any game you can play with your friends immediately becomes that much more engaging once you all get together. I was on the cusp of selling this game just two days after I bought it, but once I found out two of my buddies picked it up and we started playing we all decided it was fun enough to keep for the moment. But we'll see how long this lasts.FINAL VERDICT:Fun with friends if you've already purchased it, and are looking for a filler game before new games start releasing this Fall, but I personally already know a dozen people who sold their copies back to Amazon, so look for some solid price drops, or deals in the used section very soon.",

        "title": "A Solid Game If You Have An Unbiased Approach",
        "body": "Yes Bungie and Activison should have mentioned in bold print that this thing needs quite a lot of hard drive space and a premium Xbox live gold membership... but the game itself isn't terrible.It's different than what I expected, but for people to claim that it's a borderlands remake are simplifying it. I've only played for a few hours now but my impression is a mixture of Borderlands, Halo, and World of War Craft.What this game takes from Halo is the graphical feel (bulky and floaty), controls, and enemy design. So what? This is Bungie's style.The gameplay feels like Borderlands in the sense that you pick a character, level him up via missions in the sandbox-style world, and some of the game is a bit repetitive and grindy. Not what I initially expected but a decent play style depending on what games you like. You also have a &#34;ghost&#34; (almost a generic Cortana) that aids you while you play. Similar to the communications you receive from characters like Clap-Trap in borderlands, though not nearly as witty or funny.Lastly, it feels like WoW (or Guild Wars... any MMORPG really) in terms of online interaction. Missions are more or less single player most of the time, unless you actually invite friends to play co-op. Every now and then you'll have a random join while you're fighting the enemies, which makes them harder to kill. But this is fine as there is nothing they can really do to interfere with you, and can only help (other than making enemies harder). And if you end up going to the hub known as &#34;The Tower&#34; you will see hundreds of random players, usually spamming the &#34;dance&#34; action button.My final comment is that this game is good, but could have been better. Although it isn't what I expected, I plan on putting hours of gameplay into it.",

There is no voice chat in game excepts in your Fireteam or in XBL Party chat, All this does is make it harder to make friends and play with other people (seeings how most of my friends avoided this game altogether) which i thought was the point. The Crucible is all I play now and I'm only Lvl 27 and haven't played in a couple weeks. This game is very bland, very underwhelming and just wasn't what I expect and I am thoroughly disappointed I paid full retail price for this s***ty game AND waited for a hour at the midnight launch.",

        "body": "Oh man... how I wanted to love this game. All the hype built up by the big gaming sites and the amazing live action commercial that should be made into a movie all by itself had me anxious to get into this game... But it's let me down in a big way.I'm bored. Plain and simple, the game is boring.PVP, boring and broken. Just make a hunter and win all the matches. PVP is broken, lots of things wrong. So aside from doing the same thing over and over for not much reward, you're basically playing the same stale poorly designed maps over and over... Add to that broken mechanics and an unbalanced class system, you've got a recipe for frustration. PVE - boring. Made a warlock and killed everything... On the 4th or so mission to Russia, I started noticing the exact same metal container was the same one I had crouched behind for cover in the previous missions. Why are the developers so lazy that the map has to be the same place for every mission? And open world? That's laughable. There is NO open world environment to speak of in this game. Add to that repetitiveness and huge time sink in an effort to upgrade gear, which you hardly ever get, you've got a terribly implemented idea that could have been so much more.Aside from all that no story. NONE! Additionally, the little guy from game of thrones is just a terrible voice actor. Hell, Seth McFarland doing Brian Griffin as ghost woulda been more enjoyable to listen to than this guy read his monotonous script.I saw a review that stated the live action commercial had more character development and dialogue than the entire game, and they were spot on!I'm seriously sad that Destiny didn't turn out like I expected. I've played games that grabbed me from the beginning with a good story and made me care about the character I'm playing and this is far from that level, by a million miles...Update: I hate wasting money, so I've given it another couple weeks. The two stars just went down to one. Not even amazing graphics and fluid gameplay can make up for this lack of substance.  I refuse to buy into the DLC will make it better mentality. I've been burned once already by bungie, why get fooled again? I won't waste another cent on them or this terrible game.I must say, in regards to the 200+ good reviews out there, they absolutely have to be suffering from denial. I can identify, they are the ones who've made it to level 25+ most likely, and spent so much time grinding this game and perhaps have some seriously good items to show for it. So they are holding on, feigning loyalty, but they know... They know as well as you or I do, that this title absolutely sucks. I'm angry at bungie, it's the biggest letdown I've ever had in respect to gaming. So much so that I will be starting up a membership to gamefly immediately. Fool me once, shame on you... so the saying goes.g graphics and fluid gameplay can make up for this lack of substance.  I refuse to buy into the DLC will make it better mentality.

It is a living, breathing microcosm,  shaped by the community with more than enough room to grow. To some the size of the game will scare them away, and there might be critics saying it's smaller than they expected but how else can they introduce fans of linear games like halo and Call of Duty to an MMO format without making it, at least at launch, a smaller version of their promise. Don't take my words at face value though. This is a HUGE game.! Sure they made the level cap 26 for now, but they have already promised new missions and loot for those of us that have hit the cap coming soon. Destiny is more than just the greatest game I've ever played, it's the single greatest entertainment product I've ever experienced. THIS is why we play games, pre-order, make lines at midnight, buy consoles at launch. THIS is the culmination of a company's struggle to bring us their dream, and have it ultimately shaped by us. THIS is the game you've been waiting for. Now get out there and find your Destiny, Guardian.!",

        "body": "Ok I normally don't write reviews but I got on here and I was confused by the lower than expected rating for this game. My whole family LOVES this game, though I am a girl with a household of boys. Does the game have issues? Yes. And from what I can see, those issues are BIG to the hard-core gamers. We are not hard-core. We are people who like playing for fun. Together. I will list my family's opinions on this game so you get a wide range of ages and what appeals to them and what doesn't. I will start with me:34 year old female- I really enjoy playing the story and missions as long as I am playing with someone else in my household. I don't enjoy the game as much when playing alone. I have played over 300 hours since release. This game is VERY repetitive and I do wish they had new missions and maybe really unique missions like kill 3 enemies at once with a grenade or kill someone while on your sparrow. Just a little more difference. But when I am playing with someone I don't too much care about that. It's just fun to play together especially strikes. The younger people in the household are hilarious when they play. Like yelling at the tv when certain things happen. I will admit to watching them play even when I am not playing. We have 3 tvs in our livingroom so there are at least 2 of them being used for gaming pretty much all the time. Overall the game is fun as long as you are playing to have fun. If you are really serious about your gaming then maybe you should find something else to do because this game is too fun for you.38 year old male- I think the game is amazing. Probably the best game since Skyrim. The multi-player part is fun. It needs to be more fair that playstation has more to offer than xbox. Needs more variation and missions. It would be awesome if there was more mystery to what is coming up like maybe different enemies or more/less enemies when doing missions. Like instead of knowing what is coming up. Needs more multi-player things to doalso other than PvP (crucible). Also wish you could turn OFF matchmaking and try playing strikes solo or with just one friend. The maps and graphics are awesome. Matchmaking should match according to stats- like if you go through and have the most kills they should match you to other people who usually have the most kills so its more even.22 year old male- Awesome game. It's addicting. Dislikes: Loading screens, stupid people, not being able to boot people who aren't helping, engrams are almost always shards, doing the best and other people not doing much but then they get the better rewards. Likes: Variety of weapons, Raids, multi-player, layout of the maps, elemental damage.11 year old male- Dislikes: Loading screens, unhelpful people. Likes: Crucible, playing with other people, everything really. It's super fun.8 year old male- Dislikes: when I get in trouble and am not allowed to play, or when low level people kill me in the crucible. Likes: I love everything about it.So basically younger people don't care about any technical things that may be wrong with it, they just think it is fun. If you are a hard-core gamer- I think this is not the game for you. I hear there is a new COD out you might wanna try ;) But if you like just playing for fun with people you know- then you will love this game. Even if there are things you don't particularly care for or that may irk you a little- you will still play this game.",

        "body": "An excellent game as long as you build a fire team and even better when you optimize a clan. Great replay value for multiplayer but story mode was short.Once you get to level 20 it changes from leveling your character from experience to leveling your gear to obtain more light. It can take a while to get your legendary gear but I chose the crucible route. Then leveling your legendary weapons can take a while.You have a story mode that flies by pretty fast. After that you have PVP options such as crucible in which you have several modes of play to choose from. 1st is control take control of 3 zones A, B, & C while you eliminate other players on a 6x6 match. Then there's clash which is pure deathmatch. Then rumble which is every man for himself. Skirmish is a fun 3x3 match where you get points for kills and revives in smaller arenas. Finally salvage which is 3x3 where you have salvage areas you must take over by defending it loading your ghost and holding the zone until the artifact is extracted.As you build up your team of friends gameplay becomes more fun and engaging. You can even set up a clan of team mates.Tougher modes such as nightfall include harder enemies, specific enemy buffs, and if all 3 of your fire team die you get sent back to orbit.The raid is developed for a 6 person team to join forces to destroy 2 bosses to obtain raid gear and weapons to be able to elevate to level 30. Once you do the raid a couple of times you get the patterns and strategies down and can run through it smoothly.The hard raid is very difficult where once you die you remain out of the game until you reach the next checkpoint with your team.I myself am a game enthusiast vs a standard hard core gamer but it satisfies both sets. With the expand ability of future packs and being a game that bungie will be supporting for years to come it's only going to get better and better.Note: always have23 strange coins in bank for when the Suros is for sale.",

        "body": "You're not going to get anything unfamiliar with this game, but there is nothing wrong with that. Bungie, the original developer of Halo, made a game that plays similar to Halo and its FUN! I use to be a non believer, I did't want to have faith in Destiny, I taught the hype was only going to last a few months, but this game is addicting as hell. Destiny is an FPS with MMO elements, while the story/campaign is a bit lacking, playing with your friend and PVP are extremely fun. You'll be going to raids/pvp for some of the best gear, farming enemies trying to make a specific enemy spawn, or hanging out in town dancing with random people. Just FUN!!The only problem the campaign really has is the diversity in the mission battles. Every time your ghost (Dinklebot) needs to scan something he'll say &#34;this can take a couple minutes&#34; then enemies will began to come in waves. There's nothing wrong with this type of gameplay but, it can get a bit boring and predictable when it happens regularly.The PvP is probably the most unique thing I've seen in a shooter. There are no power weapons on the map, no one is fighting for a sniper rifle or rocket launcher. Whatever you have on your character is what you use for the PvP. I went in to PvP at level 8 thinking I was going to get rekt by some high 32 player but I didn't. I was able to hold my own and pull up some positive K/D's against the other players. However, level 32 players have higher armor so it forced me to aim only for the head.In my opinion this is a most buy item if you're into shooters/Halo. I always tell myself &#34;a game is only worth my money if it last me at least a year of play&#34; and this is that game.",

        "title": "The Most Frustratingly-Incomplete Best-Made Game of 2014",
        "body": "Destiny gets all the gameplay parts of being a game nearly perfect, sadly it's all packaged in a way that is frustrating.On the plus side, Destiny has great Halo-style gun+grenade+bash gameplay. It's fluid, fun, and challenging, and the loot system generally works well (made better by the game's use-it-to-improve-it weapon/armor upgrade system). I'm not into online multiplayer, but the shared world actually works really well (like Dark Souls, with all the PKing and suicide-inducement removed), particularly when random public events pop up and you end up working together with 2 or 3 anonymous strangers to beat a timed mission. The maps are big and fun with lovely visuals (though frankly, I wouldn't have minded if Bungie had made smaller maps, but with more variety), and once you're actually in the missions, the game loads smoothly.Then there's the negative side. The biggest problem is not the story, as many have said, it's actually the lack of local co-op which is just plain unforgivable. For a game that is obviously designed to be primarily a co-op shooter, it makes no sense and basically means you have to buy multiple copies (and have multiple consoles) if you want to play it with friends or family. Likewise, the game is constantly pushing you towards playing multiplayer (in this respect, Destiny reminded me a lot of Dead Space 3, which also seemed to hide half of its game behind &#34;co-op only&#34; doors). The strike missions, for instance, are only playable in a 3-man fireteam (even though the game seems to indicate you can play them solo), even if you don't want to play with others and have reached a level where the mission would be doable solo, the game forces you into joining a fireteam, whether you want to or not. Sure, if I was less antisocial that wouldn't be a big deal, but it represents a wasted opportunity to give players an additional challenge (apart from the weekly random nightmare strike, which, bizarrely, IS playable solo (why???)). Ok, now that I've got those out of the way, it has to be said (again); Destiny's story is a pain. It isn't necessarily stupid or uninteresting, but it's told in such an uninvolving/mundane/confusing way (Oh, how I missed Cortana whenever Peter Dinklage's Bit (Urr, I mean Ghost...) phoned in another bit of exposition) that by a few missions in you'll be wishing for a cut-scene skipping button (another mistake) and unless you take the time to literally leave the game and read the grimoire on Bungie's website, it's doubtful that you'll understand what you're doing or why it matters. The game doesn't seem to care about developing characters or its universe (despite the massive amount of effort Bungie obvious put into it), and its RPG elements are strictly limited to character/equipment leveling, don't expect to actually have any choice in how the story progresses as this is a surprisingly linear experience. Finally, because the game must be played &#34;online only&#34; whenever Bungie has a slight server problem, expect to lose your mission progress (I did 4-5 times in the one week I played).So when you get down to it, Destiny is a lot of fun to play (in the week that I had it from the library, I certainly played a ton of it, enough to get to level 22), but Bungie made a number of bizarre design decisions, limiting its appeal to a solo player like myself, and the story missions are painfully uninvolving (characters literally tell you that they aren't going to explain things to you on multiple occasions, and then act as if we should care (???)), so much so that I ended up spending more time just wandering around picking up random patrol missions, doing bounty missions, and public events (my only emotional reaction upon finishing the story missions was my annoyance at the lack of a story-completion achievement), and if that sounds fun to you, or you like playing with strangers, then Destiny is at least worth a rental.",

In some cases the game has levels that can only be played in conjunction with others.  I have half my friends list playing this game so it is a moot point.  The only issues I have are with how quickly you can run through the leveling system.  Not a deal breaker but I feel at 20 levels the carrot is a little to easy to achieve.  That aside their is a huge amount of end game content to strive for.  A plus to the game is the lack of public chat.  It requires you to group up with some one in a fire team to hear them speak.  A bonus for those who don't want to hear profanity at a constant.",

I know that I was supposed to see a lot of other players in the missions but only seen maybe a total of 10. I saw none as I got further in the missions. I tried loading the multiplayer up several times and never got it to work. I went in optimistically but the more I played I was just beginning to regret my purchase.",

Mario for the Nintendo was more emotionally involving than the Destiny campaign.  The game play is so repetitive an unrewarding that it will make retirement home bingo seem like an adrenaline rush.  The multiplayer is the least exciting experience I have yet to play from any game.  Most game modes will be 3vs3 to a maximum of 6v6.  Are you kidding me?  We have games like battlefield supporting 64 players but destiny only gives you a maximum of 12.The loot system is trash.  Your first 20 character levels are based off an experience point system.  After that, you are at the mercy of the game to bless you with high level drops which is the only way to get above level 20.  Be ready to literally run in circles for HOURS trying to be blessed with a drop that will most likely turn into an item for a different class than your own.My advice, avoid this game.",

The short story for one. The game developer compensates for it by allowing you to go online and explore pieces of history you find while playing. The game has repetitive missions you do in order to level up. It's not terrible for anyone who has dealt with grinding in other games. Lastly, until you reach level 25 (capped at level 32 when you purchase the expansion) you will not feel like you're getting anywhere. Once you do you will find yourself playing every chance you get. Even just to play one strike mission before work. With a game this addicting I can see past the few flaws. It's definitely worth five stars.",

The &#34;campaign&#34; or &#34;story&#34; mode, whatever you want to call it, is ok until your character levels up to 20, then it just ends?? Unless you buy DLC, of course.  And there's no storyline at all.  Your character gets resurrected from an ancient car wreck at the beginning of the game, and then you're thrust into this war against &#34;The Darkness.&#34;  No explanation, no back story, nothing.  And then we have (sigh) multi player.  The higher ranked players always have the more powerful weapons, so they always win.  And 90% of the time you're killed by someone camping with a rocket launcher or overpowered shotgun.  As a serious Halo player, I'm very disappointed in Bungie's feeble attempt to compete with Halo since moving on.

I wan't to love it, but I just can't ignore the shortfalls.  That said I'm enjoying the game a great deal for what it is.    Let's start with Graphics:  Personaly I think they are actually really good.  I'm not really a graphics nerd though.  If a game looks good to me I don't spend a lot of time analysing them.    Music:  I've found myself at several moments in the game thinking that the music just didn't fit what was going on.  It's not a bad soundtrack, it just dosen't seem to fit real well to me, but at the same time I don't find it detracts from the game in any way.    Gameplay:  This is what makes or breaks a game for me, and in Destiny I honestly find it a bit of a mixed bag.  The firefights are fun and for the most part well done.  However, they get to be a bit repetative.  It seems that each mission is a bit more of the same.  Run from point A to point B, kill everything in between and then defend your ghost as he acesses some ancient computer.  I feel they could have used a bit more imagination to add some variety to the missions.  Especially since you are pretty much forced to repeat missions as you level.    Online Interactions:  This is where I feel they really could have done a better job.  There are lots of other players running around in the world beside me and other than to wave or dance with them I have no way of communicating with them.  In my opinion this seriously hurts the multiplayer aspect of the game.  An optional proximity chat would have been nice.    Story:  In my original review I didn't touch on the Story so I'm editing this to add some quick thoughts pertaining to this.  Honestly I'm now approaching level 20 and I'm not even real sure what the story is.  It's mostly told in little blurbs from your companion ghost.  There are however a few cutscenes there are actually fairly well done.  In my opinion these cutscenes show off what the story could have been.  The voice acting in them is decent, and there is even a bit of humor thrown in.  Most importantly your character actually has a voice in these cutscenes.  I would have loved to see them add a lot more of these scenes even if just short ones.  They help you care about the story and your character.  Unfortunately, they are few and far between and it leaves you not really feeling pulled into the universe and the story of the game.  Of all my complaints this is probably the biggest and most disapointing aspect of the game for me.  I really wanted a great story to lose myself in during the many hours I'd be spending in this universe.  I wanted to care about my Character and his fight.  Unfortunately I'm not even really sure what that fight is for.    Now all that said, the simple fact is that I'm actually having a lot of fun playing the game.  I find myself drawn back to it as I'm sitting here now wishing I could be at home playing it.  So the game isn't a bad game at all.  I don't know how long the fun will last as I'm already level 16 and the soft level cap is 20.  I'm not sure if I'll find myself drawn in enough to want to try and grind out the gear needed to attempt the endgame raid.  I honestly hope I am.    I won't comment on the multiplayer PVP aspect of the game since I have no interest in it and won't touch it.    Edit (9/23/14): Ok so its been two weeks.  I've managed to get a Hunter to level 26 and a Warlock to 22.  I have spent close to 100hrs playing this game to this point.  I would say I had fun for the first 40-50hrs and then it just became one big repetative grindfest.  When the best way to get gear in a game is to stand in front of a cave shooting at anything that pops it's head out for hours on end.. well that game has serious issues.  Destiny without a doubt is a game full of issues.  I am as of today no longer playing it and will be trading it in next week for Forza Horizon or Shadow ofMordor.  I spent more hours than I should have with this game hoping to find that it would get better.  It don't.  I haven't done the raid and wouldn't ever have a chance to without having five other friends playing the game.  Most of my friends quit after they beat the story and realized the amount of time and dedication it would take to gear up thier toon further.  Anyway, at this point I can't recomend this game to anyone but the hardcore player who has literally unlimited time to thow away grinding.",
