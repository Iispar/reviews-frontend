        "title": "Many improvements, what a blast!",
        "body": "I've been a fan and player of the Battlefield series since 1942. I took the console jump with the XBLA 1943, and this series has been my primary FPS of choice since Bad Company 2. If you are like me in this, or perhaps you are a gamer looking for something besides Call of Duty, I really have no idea why you won't love Battlefield 4.DISCLAIMER: Please be careful with the reviews that give this game a single star due to the server issues. EA has patched most of the problems away, and if you go on major forums like GameFAQs for this game you'll see most gamers are playing this just fine. Onto the meat...If you've never played Battlefield before and picked up this one, be prepared for a nerve-racking adrenaline rush. There are several game modes: 32 vs 32 Conquest (think King of the Hill on a massive scale; it's my favorite game mode), Rush, TDM, Domination (Smaller version of Conquest essentially), Obliteration, and more. The guns in this game play very realistically, so expect recoil, and a slew of vehicles like tanks, AA trucks, various boats, jets, and helicopters all with varying types within each category are on the battlefield depending on the game mode you desire. Whether you're an infantry-buff like me or love the feel of transporting your 'squad' (teams are divided into several squads of 5 for you to spawn in and interact with) across the game's sprawling, beautiful maps, there' something for everyone interested in this FPS-war game by DICE. Your heart will be pounding as tank shells whizz by while flying in a helicopter or you watch the skyscraper you were just at the top of crumble as you parachute down to an enemy-infested area.One of the most crucial keys to recognize is there are four classes to utilize: Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. Without going into too many details, each class carries a specific type of gun selection -- for instance Engineers use Carbines and smaller PDWs while a Support primarily uses LMGs-- as well as an ability like health packs and repairing tools. The overall idea is to use your abilities with your teammates in conjunction with a game mode's objective to blast your way to victory. That's right, folks: winning is just as important if not more than KDR. On top of this, the environment is destructible in almost every way, so think twice before camping lazily in that little warehouse in the corner of the map!With the basics out of the way, let me touch on the improvements many veterans may be interested in hearing about. First and foremost, the destruction... My goodness, the destruction! One thing I was immensely sad about in BF3 was the lack of destruction compared to Bad Company 2. While still not quite back to the ability of leveling everything and anything as in BC2, DICE has fortunately returned just how much you can destroy in this fourth installment. Massive structures won't be able to be damaged externally, but now you won't be disappointed with certain towers and buildings not being blown apart though they look like they should be. Engineers, you'll have a field day.Another major improvement is in the attachments for the guns (which, speaking of guns, are right on the money as they were IMO in BF3). As DICE has seen their game grow and have added in various perks and attachment options to compete with the options given in other FPS's, what would end up happening was regardless of the options gamers often ended up putting on the standard Suppressor/Silencer + Grip combo whenever possible. However, it seems DICE has really dived in deep here by having both a true pro and con with every attachment (This was done in BF3 though half-baked as mentioned before). Want to reduce your recoil on the first shot of your trigger an general muzzle climb? Well throw on an Angled Grip and a Muzzle Brake, but don't expect the MB to help out your gun's accuracy. Want to run in guns a-blazing without revealing yourself on the mini-map?A Tactical Laser light and a Suppressor will do the job, but you may end up having quite a bit of recoil. I think you get the idea; BF4 gives more meaning to attachments in a way that makes you analyze your guns more closely while appreciating your kit choices noticeably more.A definite change to the series is a feature called Battlepacks. Those who played Mass Effect 3's multiplayer will recall these from EA putting them in there, too. Essentially as you level up and rank up your weapons you will unlock these. These are 'treasure chests' that give you free camo colors, attachments, etc., once you open them. The items you get are randomized, and as you get higher in overall rank and complete advanced assignments you will unlock Silver and Gold Battlepacks which contain rarer items/attachments. To my knowledge you can't buy these with money in any way, so they are a nice incentive to keep on playing.One of the larger changes is the introduction of Commander slots in the massive Conquest mode. One player of each team fills this slot and has a bird's eye view of the map at all times. They have an array of abilities to use to assist the actual players on the ground, such as UAVs to reveal enemies, supply drops, cruise missiles, and more. A good Commander can change the tides of battle, constantly revealing enemies and alerting individual squads to a part of the map where a crucial engagement or objective is occurring. So important is this role that you have to be ranked level 10 or higher to play it, and if a Commander is doing a lackluster job their team can boot him out of the slot. What's neat is if you have a tablet, you can go on the BF4 Commander app and join a game for the sole purpose of playing Commander. You don't even have to have the game on at home; play this wherever you have a good connection. Multitaskers and RTS fans will really enjoy this.Other than these improvements, the game just overall feels more smooth and tight than before However, I'd guess that 1080p and 60fps would do that, as well as just the overall nuts and bolts of improved audio and different alerts/noises. This game looks so much better on PS4 than it did on my Xbox 360, and it's insane how the game keeps up its smoothness when in those 32 vs 32 matches. As usual, DICE has really killed it with the maps, and if you're a fan of Rush you'll really like the sequences that completely change some maps as Attackers destroy the consecutive A and B points. Paracel Storm is crazy!What I highly recommend you to NOT do is buy this game for Single Player. This is a Multiplayer game to the point that it surprises me DICE doesn't just do away with SP. It' snot that the campaign is horrible, just don't expect the level of plot and character development you could find in a shooter like Killzone instead (not to mention its lack of longevity). I'm serious, though; if you don't play Multiplayer you are wasting $60.TL;DR - this game is even more epic than its predecessors with better attachments, destruction, and added features not previous in past installments. The game looks amazing as expected. But PC players migrating to console may not be quite as excited.",

You're constantly kicked out of multiplayer matches and I'm forced to either eject the disc or quit the game and reload it. Sometimes the game just randomly locks or something and brings you back to the xbox dashboard. You'll start a multiplayer match and then it will just stop doing what it was doing and you'll have to reload it. I generally can play one successful game and then it locks up to where I have to quit and restart the game. Right now I actually turned on my computer and started to right this review because I'm annoyed at how often this happens. This has been like this from the day I got it. The blank screen with the rain is the first thing you see generally when you load back up the game and that's why &#34;I know the rain so well.&#34;",

        "title": "New Modes, Endless Fun",
        "body": "With a solid internet connection I have found the game to be far, far more fun than frustrating.  Beautiful graphics, semi-solid all around gameplay; when climbing objects there is some problems, sometimes I still get shot by someone I knew I shot or the game is just not visually updating my opponents correctly.I have played BF4 since it came out almost everyday and I still look forward to playing this game, few titles stand this test over months.Obliteration is almost perfectly designed, the maps really lend to this game mode the best.  Obliteration is reminiscent of football in many ways.  Other games and game modes have come close to this analogy of course (like COD Sabotage), but Obliteration really nails it.  There is a real momentum that builds when your team is doing well, but it can be swayed to the other team by a &#34;Big Play&#34; even if that team is being crushed (or vice versa).  Having a parachute spawn point is very smart.  The only thing I see missing is a tie-breaker when there is a draw.  Something like; start the map over with bomb in the middle, the first team to get and hold the bomb for 30 seconds wins.  Show a countdown.  I know it was originally intended to be a 60 minute timer, but am guessing this caused server problems, quitting?Rush mode is slightly subpar compared to BF3.  It is clear the maps were designed for large scale warfare and don't do as well for the more intimate Rush mode.  For me, and I think most others, rush is at it's best in urban settings.  Nonetheless it is still fun on most maps.I never really liked conquest so am biased against it, but the 64 player version is definitely more enjoyable than BF3.  There are moments where it is great, but being an impatient gamer I do not have much fun in this mode.Hardcore mode has become virtually unplayable unless you are sniping, using a DMR, or don't mind constantly being sniped / hiding from snipers.  I really hate the sound the DMR's make, plus the use of them has been abused by Hardcore Mode gamers.  I used to only play hardcore and now I never do.I am looking forward to Naval Strike Titan Mode...ound the DMR's make, plus the use of them has been abused by Hardcore Mode gamers.

        "body": "Ok before I go any further I love the game! 64 players is awesome! The guns are sweet the customization is great! So many options and being a guy that actually shoots guns seeing all the options. That aren't fake and ridiculous makes it great! The vehicles are fun and again the options are endless! The maps for the most mart are great and challenging I'm just a little disappointed in the levolution! It's not as game changing as they said it would be.Now the reasons why I'm giving 2 stars despite to info above...First the game crashes constantly! You loose all your data from the round and I was even in the middle of the campaign and lost everything from it crashing.The game lags constantly especially on Lancang dam.There are several other bugs like one hit kills from assault rifles etc...The game takes forever to find a server! I probably spend a good 1/3 of my time trying to get into a game after it crashes or I just turn my. Xbox one on and start the game.Dice rushed the game and left too many holes in the game and even after the recent update the game doesn't seemed to have improved much if any.Conclusion,The game is great bad despite the issues it's still better the COD that's if you like the realistic physics, better graphics and a more dynamic world. That being said though wait for a bit until the game stabilizes and the bugs are gone. Dice was good though in giving players 2xp for a week and scope for the M1911. I think dice should have given us more considering the frustration, lack of customer support etc.So if ignoring the bugs the game is 5 star worthy but now 3 stars is generous to say the least. So again wait for a bit to buy the game and when you get the game get premium it's well worth the extra cash. I had premium for BF3 and it was worth it.UPDATE:The game is a lot more stable now that a new update is live. The only thing that I hate now is the bs moments that plague video games like getting shot even though your around a corner etc... Which makes my guit from irritation but then again I'm not that great eitherlague video games like getting shot even though your around a corner etc... Which makes my guit from irritation but then again I'm not that great either",

It is, in my opinion, the best shooter to ever come out for Xbox 360 so when Battlefield 4 was announced, I knew I had to get it. The first thing that stuck out to me was the wealth of weapon and class customization options. There is quite a bit more options than in BF3. There is also alot more game modes to choose from. Now for the negatives that immediately jump out: (on Xbox 360, anyways) the game runs very poorly. There is quite a bit of texture pop in when first spawning in, and you'll get random moments when the audio will completely disappear for 5+ seconds. The biggest problem of all (to me) is that conquest and other vehicle heavy game modes are unplayable on Xbox 360. During intense vehicle battles the framerate drops significantly and has even caused my Xbox to completely freeze up more than a few times. If you get the Xbox 360 version than I'd advise you to stick to TDM, Domination, Rush, and other infantry based game modes that will only have a few vehicles. In short, fun game that I play quite frequently but I can not rate it based on fun when it runs this poorly. If you have the choice, get it for new consoles or PC.",

        "title": "It would be 4 stars if it was sold as Multiplayer only.",
        "body": "I have long maintained that videogames these days should be split into two different versions, the multiplayer and the singleplayer as different products so you can buy exactly what you want and dont have to pay more for an experience you don't want. Battlefield 4 is one of those games. I'll only be covering the mutiplayer as the singleplayer I can summarize like this: It has very dry characters, the story isn't particularly gripping, you have a lot of fancy looking setpiece destruction, and you don't have to kill only Russians anymore. Now you have Chinese! You also get a new weapon by finishing each campaign level so that is the only reason I would really recommend going through it aside from achievements.    - Battlefield definitely delivers on combined arms combat. As a game with a lot of room to move around on the battlefield, there are plenty of ways to get from A to B while killing people along the way. The vehicles feel very responsive (sometimes too much so) and move with some heft.    - Very in depth unlock system. There are many things to unlock in this game and they are no longer linked to your overall combat level. The unlocks are split into a couple different categories. One is for your class, the other is for your weapon types. Each level independent from one another. If you want to get new assault rifles, using assault rifles will soon award you with a new one. If you want more engineer unlocks, using the engineer (regardless of what weapon you use) will net you points for more unlocks. These unlocks are staggered fairly well and allow you to get something new every few matches once you set to work.    - Battlepacks. Every few combat levels, you will be awarded a battlepack which will open and give you random attachments or camo for your weapon or uniform. Most of these items are only available through battlepacks and not able to gain them through leveling. You will also never get two of the same item. I put this separately because the mechanic is more of a loot system than an unlock system. You will get one of these battlepacks every 3 or so combat levels you gain and these packs vary in quality. They range from bronze, silver, gold, premium(for premium members only) and weapon specific. Once you max out a weapon level and gain all of its leveling attachments, any additional score will go towards battlepacks that have attachments just for that weapon. I feel this gives a healthy amount of re-playability and change to the game.    - Maps and Scale. All the maps have a breathtaking amount of detail. Some are more well designed than others and even this varies between modes, but the sheer scale and design are something I rarely see elsewhere. Some maps are not meant for some modes, but since a good deal of them seem to work well regardless of the game mode chosen I won't take anything away. They can range from an old cold war tank factory that has been overgrown and reclaimed by the local foliage to an aircraft carrier that has been split in half and you are fighting on what remains of the sinking ship.    - Level Destruction. This game basically delivers what they promised with Battlefield 3. Lots of crazy destruction. While it isnt as complete as say, Bad Company 2, it is leaps ahead of Battlefield 3. Hopefully with more experience with the Frostbite Engine and the new power of a next gen console, we will see more total level destruction.    Multiplayer Cons    - Connection issues. Right now Battlefield 4 is rife with connection issues. I have been disconnected from games and I cannot tell if it is because of a hotfix that kicked me from my game or if the game itself has frozen. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the game leaves you no real way to restart or refresh it to reconnect. Since the Xbone can update a game without restarting it, this problem might be solved with disabling your xbox from automatically updating while you are playing. This shouldn't have to be done this way.    - Lag. As I am sure that many others have said there has been a certain amount of lag. Sometimes there is sputtering and sometimes its things like sniper rounds not landing or getting shot well after you moved out of the line of fire. With dedicated servers, this shouldn't be happening. I haven't experienced this a whole lot, but it is there enough that it deserves a mention.    - You have very little options when it comes to customizing the controls. If you are used to some of your other controls in other console battlefield games, this one doesn't seem to want you to change much or back to what you are used to. There is little variety about how you can change your controls and after a lot of trial and error I still cant find a good setup that feels perfect for me. The addition of the 'battlelog' button on the controller where the 'spot' controls used to be was another unwelcome change.    -You can only customize your loadout in game, in a practice mode, or on your PC with battlelog. There are no more in game menus that let you customize your loadout from the main menu. Why this was not included is mindboggling. I think it just has more to do with DICE and EA's push for more battlelog integration.    -There is s*** that you look like you should be able to jump over or through but can't. This is probably the worst offender I have found in this game. I hate shooting out a window only to find that I cannot in fact climb through the window or have trouble jumping over the obstacle. This very jarringly breaks immersion and with how some debris is on the ground, I have gotten killed by other while trying to navigate objects that I shouldn't have an issue pressing 'A' to get over.    - If you are new, you are going to have a really rough first few matches. The game does a poor job integrating you into it. You will get matchmade into a game where you as a level 1, will often go against players that are in the 30s to 60s. Maybe even higher. There should be a separate pool for new players who want to get acclimated to the game where you will fight other people until maybe level 10 when you have enough upgrades to stand on your own without feeling constantly outgunned.    - There are really no classes until you level them. Almost all of the basic tools you will need to function as your desired class are surprisingly absent until you but substantial time into leveling your class. I have never been healed, revived, or given ammo by another player in an online game simply because to a majority of these players, the basic tools are unavailable to them until their class is almost finished leveling.    Conclusion  All in all, Its a pretty good game. The multiplayer is solid and while it has its fair share of issues, it has the potential to come into is own the same way Battlefield 3 did. Hopefully some of the issues get remedied, and it will result in a better experience for everyone, but the singleplayer is still pretty bad.",

        "body": "This is an amazing game. It creates incredible moments, finally achieves what many Battlefield games have tried to before and more or less managed. The feeling of epicness is like no other game can create, and when it works, it works amazingly well. The problem is, for many people, including myself for quite a while after the latest patch, the game is completely and utterly broken. Server and lag issues have been plaguing the game, I would get horrible rubberbanding for a while until I recently found a fix that had to do with my router configuration. Not to speak of the game crashes that would randomly occur during the first month. Obviously, it is unacceptable to release an unfinished game, and this will leave a very bad mark on EA and DICE's reputation, but as I stated before, the quality of the game remains undeniable.I highly recommend this game, as long as you're aware of the issues and are ready to deal with them.",

This is the only game I bought with my PS4 and probably the only one I'll have for a while. I only play multiplayer, and played the crap out of BF3 on PS3 before this came out. I'm happy to say I feel justified in purchasing a console for this game alone, as the increased quality of the graphics, the detail and fidelity of the environment, the bump up to full 64 player maps \u2014\u00a0it's all worth it. I was hoping for native 1080p with the new generation, but as it is (900p) it's still quite impressive. Go ahead and pay for Premium, it was worth every penny with BF3. Looking forward to seeing the rest of the maps as they're released.",

I mean sure it had the overpowered weapons such as USAS with frag rounds and of course the M16A3, but at least the game worked  Now for Battlefield 4... the single player for this game... not really worth it, I mean sure it's visually stunning but I found it more annoying than fun. Plus my saved game got corrupted at one point and I had to start all the way from the beginning so, yea, no thank you.  The multiplayer on the other hand is very fun in my opinion. Although since the release, the game had been broken with bugs, glitches, intense lag, game crashes, etc. But over time the game has been tweaked and patched extensively, and it's ALMOST fixed. I get the occasional forever loading screen, but it's not as serious as the first months of gaming.  Even with all the troubles which I have had with this game... I still have to say it's a fun game. I owned and played Battlefield 4 on the PS3 since the release, but when I upgraded to the PS4, my collection felt empty and I knew I still had to play this awesome game.  But I won't go premium until the game is truly 100% fixed.",

Graphics are great, game play is amazing, and audio is very improved from Battlefield. Some problems I had with the game was sometimes audio skipped or wasn't synced up with what was happening on the screen. Also, the game would randomly delete all of my progress in the campaign, which made me restart the campaign several times just to finish it once. Multiplayer is fun, but occasionally there is a lot of lag, which might just be my Wi-Fi's fault or the server's fault. Overall, this is a great game that I really enjoy.",

        "body": "Goodness. I have too much to say, but don't want to waste a lot of my time. I love Battlefield! I love it! But DICE really was crunching for the launch day release time. The game is basically still in beta; every patch fixes an issue, but causes 5 more. The game still likes to randomly quit while loading maps and the server browser is a joke.The last patch broke the browser entirely and the latest brought some functionality. Imagine it showing 60/64 connected, but you still get queued with 2 other people. Even if you aren't queued and you join a game you just refreshed the browser to find, many times it pumps you into the next map. You have NO WAY of quitting the server until the map is done loading, a 30 second endeavor on the smallest maps. Even if you quit BF4 or try to sign out to speed the process up, once you get back on the main menu, it will rejoin you to that game (meaning another 30 to 60 second of map loading before quieting. My suggestion for them is to hide games that are nearly over, or at least give the option for us to choose. But no matter what, if the game is done and players are at the countdown, hide the server or SHOW THE NEXT MAP as the current map on the browser.Game play constantly change. They nerf or boost the power of weapons and vehicles server-side, many times with no warning or change log. The latest patch messed up the health bar of the person that just killed you, so their health will show up as 0 while if you were the only one to bring their HP down and someone else kills them after you, you get 73-80 point for assist. Meaning the kill screen should have shown something around 20 points left.I'm bored of ranting. Their best way of making up for the BS they've laid out for us to beta test, would be to offer premium for no high than $20. Ugh.",

I even go back and play BF3 instead of BF4.I suggest to rent the game and see if you like it, only good part about it is I didn't pay the whole retail price for it, but now $25 feels like too much for this game.",

I got the day one edition and BF4, and I think the game is great! but getting the game to work is a problem, I get dashboarded atleast once out of every 3 matches.. sometimes 1 for 1, but the best its been is 3 games then get dashboarded. Or you will be in the middle of the game, probally your best game and get dashboarded. That and the stupid pop up messages, saying do you want to play with your friend, on this map.. takes up whole screen can't control person.. I was in a jet, and crashed into a building because of that message.. completely retarted!! After playing 2 levels/chapters in bf4 campaign it deleted my progress on its own. People can already glitch in metro! which im happy with xbox recording on command so i can record those cheaters, and people who ruin the game and report them with proof now! finding a server is horrible, and the maps i pick, sometimes put me in a completely diffrent game.. i think the game is great when it works, but for now its only good to be my coaster to set my beer on while i watch football and hockey games. party chat doesn't work while you try to start it up while playing the game. although we did find out if you quit the game completely, then make a party, then you can stay in party chat and play with friends.. still its completely unnecessary to do all that just to talk with friends.. if the game works like it should i'd probally give it 5 stars, because it is fun, and can be great.. but it only works about 25% of the time, so ti'll about march save your money.. because game is 60, premium is 50.. so save your money ti'll game is fixed!",

The majority of shooting consists of simply running into someone else, shooting blindly and hoping you hit someone. Shooting in this game almost feels similar to shooting in Fallout 3. Its like shooting with chopsticks.In BF3 Sniping/Recon was made more challenging but equally do-able, at least in hardcore. In regular mode it was basically useless. Here they screwed sniping further by making no standard sniping/open maps. The ones that do exist can only be accessed by purchasing map packs for like 20 dollars. In fact, half of all maps can only be accessed through map-packs, post-purchase downloads. So someone buying everything ends up investing like 200 into a videogame. Its insane.",

        "body": "So, with all my reviews, I like to consider the source. Is it a seasoned player or just someone that bought the game as their first ever FPS. Needless to say, this is not my first FPS. I have owned pretty much every COD, Battlefield, FarCry and a few others. Its pretty much all I have played on PC and 360. i prefer playing PC, but I cant keep up with the tech (or at least my wallet) so I frequently turn to console games for fun.First off, if you have never played a Battlefield game, this may actually be a pretty fun game. Other than all the glitches, freeze up, stalled loading screens, horrible spawns, and so on. But if you have nothing o base the game off of, you would probably be pretty impressed.I am coming from playing BF3 since it came out. I have spent many hours playing that, since i was not too happy with CoD BLOPS 2. This game pretty much took nothing from BF3. Even the default controls are different. Which was really strange for me, and I still have not ironed out the kinks. I am writing this review if you are considering leaving BF3. I word. Dont!People like to read Pros vs. Cons, so i will try and sum it up there. Here we go:Pros:- Graphics are pretty nice. Its not a huge upgrade from BF3, but the explosions and sequences are very nice, although overdone sometimes.- There are SO many ways to upgrade your weapon, soldier (if you like to play dress up), all the kits have more than enough options although the menu to do it is rather clunky and hard to navigate.- Story mode is alright. Tolerable and better (I think) than most CoD ones.Thats about it. I cant think of much else.Cons:- Constant freeze ups, stalled loading screens, kicked from servers, lost connections etc.. At least 1 in 3 of my tries to join a MP game the console freezes and I have to shut down and restart it completely.- Graphics intense game causes major graphic loading issues. Im sure this will be smoother/ better on the XBONE and PS4, but for these consoles, the games are just WAY too graphics intense to run smooth. Constant frame rate drops with half of my field of view :loading' as I walk forward. Enough to notice. Even sometimes looking down a sniper scope the buildings/ plants etc are not even there. Its just a brown or gray area with a person in it.- Glitch crazy maps! Walking around in MP maps, there are people halfway in the floor below and halfway aboe the floor. But still able to shoot and kill. Also people sliding around the mas on their bellies faster than running, able to shoot like crazy. Many more examples of this with players doing wacky things, all the while able to shoot and kill you.- Sniper rifles are crazy powerful, and people are either quickscoping or shooting from the hip with 1 shot kills. Super annoying.- 'Noob tubes' (grenade launchers) are WAY overpowered.- Takes FOREVER to upgrade weapons/ kits. I have played for probably about 12 hours. 2 hours of story, and the rest multiplayer. Although you can unlock a couple things through the story, you are going to have to spend some serious time to unlock any weapons. You end up using the same weapon for quite some time, with no real variety or way to change it up. Pretty annoying. And this is finishing in the top 3 players with each round, give or take a few.- Game modes. The modes are pretty lame. Its either a small map deathmatch, or a huge match of 'CTF'. They have a new mode with a bomb that I havnt played much, but maybe it its alright. Wanted to play what I knew so I could judge the game. Most maps have the same III format. Linear maps, with a left 'lane', right 'lane', and a 'choke point' in the middle. except a few maps that have the islands, but there is so much open area it makes sniping so damn simple and easy.- Spawning into games with no sound for about the first 30 seconds. Gun not in front of you for up to a minute. Graphics rendering after a super long load time.Well, my fingers are tired, and I could go on about cons. There are more, trust me.All in all, this game is mildy fun to play at best, to me it is not at all more fun that BF3. I dont really see a reason to upgrade. I would like to see how it is on the next gen consoles, then re-review the game. I feel like with more updates/ patches (typical fashion for EA), and by the time the PS4 comes out it will hopefully be a better game. In the meantime I might still play the game mixed in with the regulars.EA needs to stop releasing games games so early just to get them out, and patch as you go. Its way too glitchy, and freezes and has way too many issues to be enjoyable. I would NOT spend $60 on this. Maybe for a PS4, but not PS3/ 360.****EDIT**** So, this is hilarious. I just finished playing for about 3 hours today. Had a day off with nothing else to do. And everything I wrote has been confirmed. Also, I turned on the TV, and looky there! A BF4 commercial. On the bottom of the screen, it says *Actual footage from Xbox One gameplay*. Hahahahaha. What a f-in joke. So you released a game, then run your ads for a system that wont even be out until a month after the game??? WTH EA?? Seriously?? Its obvious that this game was never intended to be played on 360 or PS3. Just blatantly obvious. Im sure it will look worlds better on the next gen consoles, but if you are going to dumb the version down for the older consoles, just dont even release it for them. I am so disappointed with this game, that I am listing on Craigslist for sale this evening and hope to have it sold soon. Its a waste of time to even attempt to play it on a 360 or PS3. Oh, and if you didnt know, the PS3 version is ONLY 720p RESOLUTION!! They could not make it 1080p, further proving the fact that it was never intended to look good or run well on the older systems. Thanks EA. Solid work......as always",

        "body": "This game can be very fun WHEN IT WORKS, and I well prefer it over COD. Three weeks in, and Battlefield 4 is still a glitchy, laggy mess, and I can't believe the quality in games has sunk this low. And EA wants me to buy a season pass or rent a server to fund their failure? I'm sick of people blaming the customer for buying something and expecting it to work, so you should know what you may be getting into. It's unacceptable and broken enough that if it were any other product, I would have demanded a refund. But, we'll just settle for promised 'patches' to make things better.First, want to bring along a few friends to play on your side? Sorry, there are no lobbies, which makes it very frustrating to get people onto the same squad in the same game. Guess they didn't think it was important. Second, if you do get people on your squad, there is a one in five chance of someone's game locking up at some point. Oh, and when this happens, you have to hard reset your entire system, because you just don't get 'kicked out' of the game. When BF4 isn't eating your PS3, it's often lagging so bad you don't get any audio, zero hit detection -- even on people standing still --and a frame rate that makes a Charlie Chaplin movie look good. There is also the occasional glitching through floors, getting stuck on objects, your grenades getting stuck in mid-air on objects, people sliding around on floors, rubber-banding lag, and other comedic stylings of EA an DICE. One of the funniest is sometimes on guns like the SCAR-21, aiming down sites with the iron sites will result in a fully blocked-out site picture to you can't see anything though the ring.When the game isn't completely screwing you, it's a great experience, but it's like this only about 35% of the time. There are some other changes I don't like regarding the vehicles, but that's personal opinion. The game being broken for tons of people is a fact. The more you play it, the more you'll realize it. And they want people to invest in a new PS4 or XBOXONE for this experience? If they haven't gotten it right BY NOW for a system that is 7 years old, then they can keep their next gen.y want people to invest in a new PS4 or XBOXONE for this experience?

First NCAA, then FIFA, madden, and now battlefield. Honestly I have mistaken battlefield 4 gameplay for battlefield 3 gameplay becomes it's just that little of an improvement that you can't tell the difference between the two games. I guess the best way I can show you his is through pros and cons so here it goes: Pros: all weapons seem balanced which can be important in an fps. The new destructable environments are cool and fun to play with. That's it. Cons: Little to no improvement as far a graphics; they are exactly the same as battlefield 3 if not worse. It is very hard to identify teammates com enimies. You constantly lag out of servers; I'm sure this will be fixed to some extent later on. No new game modes were added and it just feels exactly like bf3. Basically the biggest con is just how little of an improvement this game is. If you told me that this game was bf3 dlc I'd probrably believe you because it feels like EA took battlefield 3 and put in new maps. If your looking for the ultimate fps expirience then look somewhere else because EA has turned into money thieving criminals with no regard for their customers. Do not trust EA.",

I play with all of the loadouts.  From close quarters to vehicles and sniping everything is fun and challenging.  The premium gets you all the maps for the year so if you like the game as much as I do and can spare $50 get the premium for all the maps of the year.  Different vehicles in these too!Only minor con is sometimes the game freezes while loading a new multiplayer game and sometimes my Xbox (Elite) gets too hot and need to shut off for 30 min. but overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes first person shooters!",

Not one update has helped. Some of the bugs are the Horrrrrriable hit detection you can crouch the second  you get shot and seconds later you can be found dead another is one shot kills from whatever gun from pistol to carbine to smg/pdw you get shot anywhere and youll be shot this happens quite often. heres a new one sometimes youll start a game and all your unlocks are gone meaning you have to back out of a game  and join a another game  from the server browser which is a joy to do in itself .In short this game is broken beyond belief and the developers dont care just stick to bf3 and dont learn the hard way like me.",

        "title": "Disappointing.",
        "body": "I've played every single battlefield since 1942 and just honestly feel let down by this release even after sinking over 200 hours (and after sinking 1000 hours into battlefield 3) into it. I was so excited for this game, that i picked up the 360 version when it came out because i didn't have a PS4 yet and i just wanted to experience the game. I played it and thinking to myself 'Really? this is battlefield?' thought, well, maybe it'll be better on the next gen consoles. Nope.    Remember how most other battlefield games made you fight tooth and nail to unlock the best weapons and attachments? Well now everyone starts with most of em and the others take all of two hours to unlock.    Remember when battlefield was all about effective teamwork and cooperation? Now, it's 64 people who rarely work as squads, running and gunning and camping in corners with weapons that kill in two or three bullets. I enjoyed battlefield for the strategic game play. I played cod for the fast paced arcade feel. Dice tried to imitate the twitch shooter style of Cod and failed miserably. Oh and remember Squad specs that you could use to help out your buddies. They're gone too and replaced with a system that only benefits you, which just adds to the lone wolf style of play.    Remember when having armor or aircraft on your side gave your team an advantage over infantry? That's gone too. Now 2/3rds of all players are engineers with one of the ten new rocket types that will rip your tank apart and cause your jet to start spinning right into the ground.  Remember when the entire environment was your sandbox to destroy? Now, very few buildings even have destructible walls and you will get caught on odd pieces of landscape every single time you try to vault over something. Instead of bringing every building down until the map is almost flat from the constant explosions as seen in previous games, we have lagolution whereby most maps are changed in some massive but largely useless manner that is aesthetically pleasing but really does not change much in terms of gameplay.  Remember fluid gameplay? Lag. Lag everywhere. Today a guy shot me out of his ass. Don't wanna know how. He was facing the other direction and rounds just started spraying from his pooper. Gotta love it.    Remember partying up with friends to play? That's gone.    Remember being able to change your classes outside of actually being in a game and being able to quickly change to a new gun for your class. Well, now you have to wait for a little personal island to load for you just so you can adjust your classes. Might as well join a game. Oh and wanna try to navigate the menus? Too bad. It's menu after menu after menu.    Like your controls in battlefield 3. Too bad.    Remember when one or two organized squads could effectively change the fate of a game. Well say hello to zulu squad with one man in it and two to three people in most others. Even if you have four buddies and you guys are all working together, it wont make much difference. Prepare to be mobbed by ten people wielding weapons that can kill you with a stray round to the chest or three to the foot.    Remember how awesome sniping used to be? Well say hello to morons trying to quick scope and every single class running around with DMRs. Oh and remember how carbines gave the engineers a crutch to stand on to make up for their lack of specialized anti infantry weapons, well now you get PDWs and everyone gets the carbines! But don't worry, people only use two of them anyways and you start with arguably the best one! Dont even get me started on the useless repair tool. Wanna try to get your buddy in the tank back up to full health. Too bad. It'll take you about five minutes to completely heal something and he's been hit by four rockets by now and you've died in the explosion.  Remember having helpful teammates that would destroy any anti-tank mines they spotted (very few people spot anymore either) so that a teammate wouldn't run over them?Better look out now, because the ground is covered in mines and your team will mostly just ignore them unless they feel especially generous for some odd reason.    I've tried to play the game for what it is but it just isn't battlefield to me. At this point, i'm going to get my last few map packs since i bought premium and then when I've played through those, i'll move onto something else. Hopefully Dice wont fail us with Battlefront. But due to this game, there is no way i'm buying the game right out the door. I'll wait and see what people think. Used to be a die-hard fan for dice who bought every product. Now, just really disappointed.  The only reason i'm not giving this game a 1,is because i like to believe Dice can do better. I like to think EA is to blame for most of the problems, but then i look at the game-play itself, and wonder, what was Dice thinking?  The only redeeming aspect going for them is that Dice is actively (if not slowly) trying to fix the problems in this never-ending beta, so at least they have that going for them.    Edit 1/9/15: Problems still exist. Game still sucks. It's just not a true battlefield in any way. Way to sell out Dice.",

Mission 6 I believe, in the campaign when you go to destroy the damn, it crashes. EVERY single time. At first my guns would disappear from my hands so I really knew something was wrong. You would just see the aiming reticles similar to if you were driving in a tank. THEN, you try to reload the game and it freezes every time at the loading screen. Cleaned the cache in a desperate attempt to get it working again and no cigar. I went online and saw that several people had the EXACT same problem at the EXACT same point in the game. So it is not my Xbox, hard drive, save profile ect. It is once again a classic example of pushing a game out on consumers KNOWING FULL WELL that it not ready. At the rate that the gaming industry has been spewing out $60 big releases that are crap...I seriously can not even imagine how bad the Xbox One is going to be when it is released. I seriously already feel sorry for all of the morons who are going to pre-order that system. Just keep in mind how horrible the 360 was when it was released. Red Rings of Death? Just imagine how bad the ONE is going to be.Update: 11/5...Still no patch from EA The graphics somehow get even worse as your progress. (I reloaded the entire chapter to get past the mission where you blow up the damn but got stuck in the next chapter as the entire level on the aircraft carrier turned into a giant invisible wall and you are barred from continuing. This is seriously an outright scam. By far, the worst product EA has ever released. The graphics are on the same level as Battlefield 2 and that is not an overstatement. (That is also after being FORCED to install 12GB worth of data just to play a game that is broken beyond belief and looks like it was made seven years ago. Amazon is refunding me in full and I suggest anyone who has it, no matter where you got it, does the same before it plummets in retail value.",

I catch myself sometimes just looking around the map in awe of the graphics. The gameplay is perfect and provides a seamless fluid experience with opportunities to create cinematic moments that aren't scripted. The competition or Cod is not even close to touching this game.

Granted I don't have to reset my Xbox every hour like before, but there are a few problems that get you frustrated during gameplay. CONS: You still suffer from random locked screens during play that freeze the Xbox and require a hard reset. Happens fewer times now, but always happens on the map Dawnbreaker. Quite a few spawns still happen under the maps. One shot kills while hiding behind cover. Personally I dislike how they changed the way you talk to teammates. You can only talk to your squad and not the whole team. PROS: There are a few maps are very fun and have very few problems. The game physics are still the best in the biz. Maps still have good and bad tactical advantages. The game, if working correctly, would be  When (hopefully) they get everything working I would definitely update and rate the game higher.",

        "body": "I like this game but just don't love it..The campaign was SHORT !! Now I know that most FPS or TPS games usually have short campaign's , but this was just way to short.. The few hours and content it did provide was very fun , I enjoyed the game all the way through until I realised I had beaten the game. At that point I was left with a feeling of &#34; this can't be the end , I have only been playing for about 4 1/2 to 5 hours &#34;. But it was the end and it left me a little dissapointed. The good thing about this game is that it doesn't end with the campaign , there is always multiplayer.The multiplayer is the redeming factor for this game , because there is countless hours of fun to be had here , not to mention the DLC ( downloadable content ) that is comming for this game to further enhance your multiplayer experience. The multiplayer is always more fun with a few friends online with you , but even playing alone you can find much enjoyment here.The graphics in this game are just excellent , and I'm not only talking about the campaign. Usually the campaign in games look way better than the multiplayer , but somehow Dice ( the developers of the Battlefield series ) pulled off an amazing looking campaign and multiplayer. The graphics in this multiplayer are second to none !! There is not another ( Console ) multiplayer out there that looks this good , period . I love the Call Of Duty series as well and I can say without a doubt NONE of those games look this good.Is this game for everyone ? No . If you are just a campaign kind of person , wait till the price comes down to around 25 to 30 bucks before you pick it up , because you will probably not be happy with the game length. Now if you are the multiplayer type you might as well pick it up now because you will deffinately get your moneys worth..",

At first I could sign out of the playstation network and then sign back in to have my loadouts and experience reloaded but now that does not even work.  It is frustrating to  play for a few hours and unlock new and better equipment only to not have them available to use.  It is a common issue and I havent been able to use my loadouts for a few days now.  And, as everyone already knows, electronic arts help and support is almost non-existent and provide no help or solutions.  I even asked for a representative to call me to help fix the issue and have not received any help (three days ago).  The game is broken on PS4 unless you want to play the game over and over without ever gaininig experience or leveling up and only using the preset default equipment.",

        "body": "I don't usually post reviews but I felt it was necessary in this case.  I received Battlefield 4 as a gift for Xbox One.  I requested BF4 because I was tired of the same repackaged Call of Duty game year after year.  Call of Duty was a game most of my friends with consoles had and we enjoyed playing together.  However after a few years of incremental updates with ongoing issues in each new version (Quick Scoping, Host disconnections, Weapon balances) I thought it would be better to get friends to try out BF4.  However, there are so many issues that lead me to the conclusion that the game wasn't ready for release even after knowing they had a semi-open beta where you would assume they worked out many of the issues.  The friends that bought the game with me have already gone and purchased CoD because they weren't happy with the problems and wanted something to play on their new console.The biggest problems I've experienced are:Lost my progress in the campaign at least twice (Now I won't even play because I have to start over every time I turn the console off)Multiplayer quick match puts you into the wrong game typeGame crashes randomly during MPOne-shot kill bug in MP (see [...]I wish you could return games like any physical product, maybe then EA/Dice wouldn't release a game before it was ready instead of relying on patches as you go.  While I expected a few issues since related to the lack of large scale Xbox One/PS4 testing, some of these issues are just plain ridiculous.Edit #1:I forgot another bug that I have seen in MP.  Sometime the screen will look like the old blue/red 3D when you move your character.  I believe people are calling this the 'Blur bug'",

I hope they'll do a push to bring back the original button config for land vehicle.

        "body": "Ok so I LOVE the battlefield series to start off. LOVE it.So issue #1. With Call of Duty and Battlefield, for me, its a MUST to play campaign through on normal, then hard mode and on battlefield beat every mission with gold. Get those head shots. Well unfortunately, its impossible unless you play it 100% through, grab the achievements, then still you dont beat it.The Battlefield campaign DOES NOT SAVE and this is a issue with 99% of Xbox One and PS4 players. Once you stop playing the game, go back to it the next day or later in the day, you have to start all over! If you play it all in one sitting. Your battlelog will have no record of it and congratulations you did it all for nothing. Its like it never even happened.So singleplayer is very much unbeatable.NEXT is Multiplayer.Nothing but connection issues, sync issues, and the game will not start off dashboard so you have to unplug your machine and do a hard reset very often.ALL THESE ISSUES ARE AFTER THE SO CALLED PATCH!Battlefield needs to be taken over by a different franchise.",

        "body": "My go to FPS for the next generation systems. My first expierenced with Battlefield has been on the PS4 and am very happy with this title. An added  tutorial is impertative to learn the schematics and controls for aircrafts. After months I still have not been able to get the flying down because of the scarce oppurtinities to do so and no tutorial as to how to operate these aircrafts. Another thing that has shed a neggative light in my eyes on EA's Battlefield series as that from day 1 an expenstion is needed to play the aircraft only maps, something i think that should be included. If i were to crack and buy the update, I do not have the ability to only purcahse the DLC that is needed to complete the game and fully enjoy what Battlefield can offer. I enjoy playing this game the most on my PS Vita. Although this took time to be able to perform at a decent skill level, I am very happy with the remote play function and the title as a whole. The 2 main problem areas have not been the slow servers, freezing, or booting, but are the fact that there is no aircrat tutorial and that you charge the price of a full game, so do not with hold content from day 1. Charging for credits in games to upgrade players is a feature that i deffintly do not aprove of but can get over. Charging extra to play the game modes that define Battlefield from other FPS is Slimmy.Adam LevensonInsureYourCompany.comThrice4966@gmail.com",

I have both and cannot tell the difference unless they were side by side. Game is defiantly a worthy upgrade from last-gen consoles with have improved graphics, 60 fps, and 64 player matches. Gameplay is really fun when your team is working together. Many people hate the campaign but I sorta of like having a shorter campaign that looks amazing and tells a story with cool cinematic scenes. Had this also on the 360 which was more or less without any fun because of the bad graphics and low frame rate drops. Would defiantly suggest this game on either next gen console! BTW, Second Assult is a beautiful dlc only on xbox one right now, capture the flag is really fun on those maps.",

Here is not the case as the glaring issues with the game it's self are simply to horrific to ignore. Constant crashes, bugs and itches throughout multiplayer and single player alike. For a mulitplayer game this has the worst interface ever and partying with friends is the single worst Xbox experience bar none.I'm sorry but this is getting a very  negative vote.

        "body": "I really do love the Battlefield series but this one is junk, don't buy it. They released it too soon and it's buggy as all get out.I've played the Campaign 4 different times and it has deleted my progress each and every time. It would make me so darn mad but had hours into playing the game and only to find out it all was for nothing.Yeah they said they were sorry and are now giving you double XP points if you play online now. Well a lot of good that does me when the weapons I unlocked during the Campaign you can't use..... HELLO Mc Fly.Just stay away from this game till they fix the issues, I pre-ordered and played Beta also but they didn't fix issues and I payed full price for a game that doesn't work.UPDATE as of December 14, 2013 after two 850 Mb update files this game is finally working like it should be. I haven't lost any of my progress in Campaign mode since the last update, but I still back-up my save file to a USB thumb drive just in case. Now I have been able to connect and stay connected while playing online. Now with all this updating this game is great, it's what I was waiting for. DICE hopefully you learned your lesson on this one and let all the bugs get worked out BEFORE releasing to the public. It really doesn't matter about COD because the fans of this game knows that this will ALWAYS be their go to game. Just keep making good games like these and don't worry about release dates, you only have one chance to make a first impression on somebody!!!!!!!!",

I can actually have fun in this shooter and generally live more than 5 seconds in the process. The vehicles are quite enjoyable though and the 64 player servers are icing on the cake. The options to customize things are expansive and the maps are well built in my opinion. Premium is an easy purchase and worth it for queue position priority and the amount of exclusive items and that's on top of the maps at a discount.",

Also, the occasional freeze or auto crash, but it's still early for Xbox one and I know the issues will get resolved. Other than that I recommend to anyone.",
