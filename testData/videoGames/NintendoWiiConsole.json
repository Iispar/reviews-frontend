        "title": "The Best System",
        "body": "I purchased the Nintendo Wii console about a week ago, and to be honest it is the best system of the three in my opinion. It took me several months to locate this system in a store. The best advise I can give anyone is to not buy this system online. The entire Nintendo Wii system only costs 250 dollars. Any true retail store will sell it to any individual for 250 dollars. Most of the people here want 400 dollars or more. If you buy the system online your going to get ripped off. I'm not going to tell anyone how to get one in the stores. If one is smart enough then one can figure it out on their own. These are the people who buy it before you can get to it, and then sell it back to you for a lot more. My best advice is to just be patient. Either go look for one in the stores, or wait until next year when the demand is not so high.",

        "body": "Wanna have even more FUN with loved ones? Wanna spend more time with someone, but can't get past awkward conversations? Wanna stream movies and TV shows to your TV, as you like? Turn on the wii, baby (& get Netflix)! From canoeing with family members, to swordfighting with friends, to cow-racing with acquaintances, to watching old episodes of Fraggle Rock, wii will have you laughing, rowing, slashing, lassoing (a la Indy!), and yes, now watching for as long as you can stand it! We've had our wii about six months, and it just got better! We just started our Netflix subscription a few weeks ago, and we love that too! With a Netflix subscription that includes the ability to stream, if you've got an internet connection to your house, you can watch any one of TONS of movies and TV shows (stuff you can't get on OnDemand!) My beau was especially excited about the 21 Jump Street Episodes :) Be prepared to spend more than just the purchase price for the wii - there are lots of fun extras that you kinda need, extra wii-motes and nun-chucks, in addition to the games (tip: always read the reviews on the games, I've bought a doozey or two, & if i had read the reviews here on amazon, I would have saved my $$ for a better game). But, if you have kids or you are even just a couple who goes out a lot, the wii (& now, netflix) may save you some money in the end, and you'll spend more time together, doing fun stuff. And after all, isn't that what life's all about?Thanks to wii and netflix, we eat at home more (saves money, gas, & calories); watch fewer commercials (they're bad for the psyche AND the wallet!); are more active with our entertainment; spend more time with family & friends; spend less time aimlessly channel-surfing; enjoy more varieties of entertainment, like documentaries, old TV shows, and musician stuff; are more conservative with spending $7-15 per person to see a movie in the theatres (that we hopefully will enjoy!); and actually look forward to spending time at home (after all, we ARE paying for it, whether we're here or not!)Gotta go, we've got a few movies in our queue, just waiting for our undivided attention!PS - I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You!time at home (after all, we ARE paying for it, whether we're here or not!)Gotta go, we've got a few movies in our queue, just waiting for our undivided attention!PS - I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices.

        "body": "I have to say first off that I am professor that teaches digital media at SMWC.edu (look it up if you want), it wasnt going to be long before I had to pick up the next gen consoles and start really looking at them physically for next semesters classes on interactive design.  Ive read the stats for months now, know the pros and cons of all of them, can talk long winded hours on each of them.  They all have their strengths.  However, standing here, in my living room, roughly 3 days after hooking up the wii next to the other two next gens, and watching the reaction it gets from my friends, their kids, even their wives/husbands... its really hands down as far as which is getting more traffic.    Now we know the graphics arguement.  But you really REALLY have to consider this thought process.... what do graphics matter if the game play is no different then it was on the past generation?  If there is no difference in response, in condition, then the development is purely surface.  A common theory is that we have entered into a stage of development where we dont create new, we simply improve upon the old.    Wii may be an improvement on old concepts, but it is a new.  It is not simply wireless remote with tilt response.  it is a vast responsive system.  It measures speed, and angle, gyration.  its connection to the system is very tight.  I had my doubts about how responsive it would be.. I was foolish to doubt.    Going back to graphics and game play.  The demo disc (wii sports) that was included is a good example of group play.  Bowling and golf are very strong titles, offering complex control of your tilt and curve of your remote.  In bowling, A friend of mine has a wicked slice and was able to simulate that perfectly by going through the same motions he does when he bowls.  Same story with golf.    Tennis and Baseball is about  your swing. You dont control the physical movement of your player, done automatically, but it shows the potential.  Also your pitch is influenceby your throw style as well.      Boxing requires the most response from the control system, and for the most part delivers.  In the heat of the fight, you tend to move less controlled, and the remote wont throw a punch unless it is a solid punch/jab, so half-a** punchs dont always register... DONT TAKE THIS the wrong way, its very minor and not often this happens.    Again, the graphics are not PS3/360 level... but why do they need to be.  We arent talking atari 4600 or ps1 level here.  We are talking crisp graphics that even the ps2 would have balked at.  smooth lines, blurs, clean.  Its nice and eye pleasing.    Outside the game, you can make your own avatar (mii) for you and your friends, if you have internet, you can set them to wander other systems, and in the end you can even have mii visitors.  The virtual console channel (its all set around channels) lets you buy new games from older consoles, so if you have the option, buy the classic controller (it hooks to the remote, so its wireless) too.  cost is no more then [..] per game, so enjoy the potential that is supposed to grow weekly (wait and see).  More channels like weather, news, and browser, are to be unlocked through january... here's hoping for more.    So, if I didnt own all of them what would I do?  Buy the wii first.  BEST all around FUN machine.  The graphics are pretty, the game play is tight, and the enjoyment certainly lasted a LOT longer then it did on the others.  More then this, it fulfilled its promise, people who arent gamers were playing, laughing, and having fun.  And then they did something else, they wanted to come back and play it more.",

        "body": "Nintendo... remember the days of Super Mario Brothers, sitting in front of the television for hours because of the excitement and total awe of the game, feeling like a child again- that is what the Wii is about. Capturing that feeling of gameplay, making it totally interactive, creative, something we've never seen before, we become part of the video game again. The system is smaller than i thought it would be - fits nicely in an entertainment system- very sleek. The controllers are so easy to use and after about 30 minutes you'll wonder how you ever played a game without them. The graphics are beautiful, smooth lines and rounded edges everywhere -no pixelated graphics here. The interface is simple to use, the instructions are self explanatory. If there were ever a system to wait 6 hours on line in Times Square in the cold, it was this one. The experience was not one I'll soon forget and owning the Wii is definitly something I won't regret. As for the price- it beats out the Xbox360 and PS3. It's affordable, innovative, fun for the whole family - kids will love the nunchuck controller and wii sports, swinging the controller around!!! I absolutely love Nintendo because they do a great job putting a high quality on the market that is affordable for everyone and innovative all at the same time. Enjoy your Wii - if you got one before they all sold out that is...",

        "body": "We own the Wii, PS3, Xbox360 and still play the older PS2, Gamecube, Xbox, PSP, DS, etc. etc. consoles (not to mention PC games). Since we have paid our dues, we have the 'right' to compare.  The biggest difference of the Wii compared to the PS3 and 360 is that it offers a substantially different approach to gaming. Because the controller is designed to be moved, swung, shaken, jerked (but not thrown at the TV) you need to stand up, move around and use your body. That's a far cry from letting your fingers do the gaming (like you do in a typical PS3 or 360 controller).  The PS3 and 360 are more powerful graphics machines. They are designed to take advantage of our new HDTVs and give us amazing graphics. You bet, they really do. Hence you pay a lot more for it. But, the Wii has proven that you really can have fun by allowing more interaction with the game's content, despite using the 'old' (standard) definition TV. Critics will go on and on about how great the PS3 and 360 technology is but games are more about having FUN and less about having a romance with technology.  Furthermore, if you are a parent who's paying for your kid's gaming, then you might want to consider BALANCING the kind or themes of games your kid is playing. I have noticed that the PS3 and 360 games my kids buy are tilted towards getting their excitement up with shooting and explosions. With the Wii, the games are more of the jumping up and down, arm swinging, and body movement kind of fun.  This leads to my final observation. All the body movement required to play many (but not all) of the Wii games contribute a few points for anti-obesity. I'm shocked at the number of hours my kids could sit down to play games on their consoles, use their PCs, and watch TV when all I could do as a kid back in my time was to ride a bike or play ball.  250 bucks is not too much to pay for the fun the Wii provides. I hope Nintendo has got a lot of imagination up its sleeves because it take a lot  of it to make more games that can really use and benefit from the Wii controller and nunchucks.",

This is a additional item that you purchase in addition to the Wii gaming Console.I was inspired for how fun it is and can be to do virtual workouts- while also losing weight and inches. While results are not drastic- It does get you up and excited to complete each day to see and track your progress. That seemed to me like a something I would enjoy. I have yet to make the purchase for the Wii fit plus- but the Wii is very fun. It's fun to watch the family aiming at things as though they exist in front of them. The control has a nice gel pad for added protection from the unexpected (Accidental tossing of the remotes). LOL!!! It has a bit of sound and vibrations that come from it as you use or play the item. While my family is not completely the gamer type- The Wii has options. The item arrived within days from Amazon- and I appreciate the fact that I do not have to pay tax on items I order from them. I live in Florida and my sales tax is 6-7% depending on the county you live in. I always save when making Amazon purchases all around. Who doesn't love savings?",

I never got into video games, because hitting buttons on a controller and just sitting there is boring to me. The Wii solves this for me and is a great way to both get exercise and play a game. Being physically active is a big part of my life, and this is a way to bridge both exercise and fun. Brilliant!    The sports games that come with the Wii are cartoony and get old after a while, but they are meant to show game developers what can be done. For instance, there is a Brunswick bowling game that is more difficult and is photorealistic than the bowling game that comes with the Wii.    I'm just waiting for them to have controllers that you strap to your wrists and ankles...",

I am now 31 and really wanted to connect to my girlfriend who was playing this stupid Farmville-like game... So to to interact with her -yes agreed it's sad,  I went to get this bundle. Let me just say, we opened it up yesterday and we had the best night! I know the WII U is out but really this is all I need. I have Hulu plus on here. It connects to your wifi...it is easy set-up and it was only 129.00 so I bought Mario and we played both. I also bought another controller (generic version but works perfect and is cooler than the one that comes with it) It is cool because you can 'multiplay' so Mario and Luigi didn't have to wait for the other to finish. We really had a blast and I am ready to play again tonight. If you want to connect and get off your behind get this Wii. I do triathlons and I was sweating during boxing last night.  The wii even offers all the old games on the console to buy right there. It really is amazing and fun. I would HIGHLY recommend this as a gift for ANYONE! Oh, and when we were tired and wanted to keep playing it prompted us to take a break. A console that reminds you to live without it for a second is pretty darn awesome!",

As reluctant as I was to get this system, I must admit that it is great.  The games are very interactive and require quite a bit of movement.  It is much better than the typical 'couch potato' interaction of most video games.  That is not to say that playing Wii sports should be confused with exercise.  It is not that, but at least players must be somewhat active.  That is a big plus in and of itself.In addition to the activity level required in some of the games, it is very fun for all ages.  I have only played the Wii sports games so far myself, but those are a lot of fun.  The games that come with the system include boxing, tennis, bowling, baseball, and golf.  I have played four of those so far and they are all quite fun.I have noticed that the prices have gotten a bit crazy on these systems this season.  Although it is a lot of fun, I don't think it is worth some of the extreme prices that it is being sold for currently.  I would recommend watching and waiting for it at the normal prices, which is about $250.",

        "body": "The Nintendo Wii is of course Nintendo's newest system, being its 'entry' into the 'next-gen' console wars.  That being said, its difficult to not overhype this system, as it does not deliver on what many gamers believe to be next-gen  (this isn't a bad thing).1.  Graphics:  True to Nintendo's history, the Wii does not deliver 'superior graphics capability' as its nemesi (Xbox 360 and PS3) claim, but thats never really been Nintendo's focus anyway.  The concentration is FUN, and that it is (we'll get back to this).The Wii does not natively support HDTV.  It comes with 'dated' composite cables to plug into the TV (yellow for vid, red and white for sound).  You can order componoent video cables from online, but in my opinion its not really needed yet as not many games out now really need it yet.  Although through firmware updates later might change this.2. Gameplay:  this is the Wii's strong point.  First off, the Wii is the first system to come packaged WITH a free game since.. the SNES years and years ago.  This game is 'Wii Sports', which as the title suggests, is a pack of sports games:  Bowling, tennis, golf, boxing, and baseball.  This is a great showcase for the innovative new controller for the system and they are great fun, even for people who dont like the real-life versions of these games (such as yours truly).  The catch is, the Wii only comes with ONE controller, so to make it a real 'play-with-your-friends' game, you have to shell out another bunch of money for additional controllers ([...] for the wii-remote, $20 for the 'num-chuck' attachment.. which is only needed for the boxing part of Wii-sports, so you could pass on that if necessary).The system also accepts Gamecube games, and those games will require Gamecube controllers (which the system has 4 built-in ports for), along with the Gamecube memory cards (of which the Wii has slots for 2). -- and while i'm in that general area.. NOTE:  the Wii does NOT play DVDs.  Although Nintendo MAY decide to add this feature later on.  This is not too much an issue though as most people these days have at least one DVD player in the house already, if not more.3.  Control  The Wii-remote (Wiimote?) is probably one of the most notable 'differences' with this system.  It looks like a standard remote control, and has an 'optional' Num-Chuck attachment that connects to the bottom of it with a wire.  You pick options on the screen with a pointer, which you move about by pointing the wii-remote at the screen.  The wii-mote is equipped with motion sensors, and thus provides most of the Wii games to use a much more interactive way to play the game, such as actually swinging the Wiimote like a sword to slash the sword in the game.  This of course could be a hinderance to some game-players, and it does take some getting used to, but in the end it generally makes gaming quite a bit more fun, and in most cases more intuitive.  The controller uses 2 AA batteries, and the provided ones are standard, so if you want a 'rechargable' option you'll have to provide those yourself.4. other stuff.  Mii's:  one of the 'channels' in the Wii system is the 'Mii' channel.  A Mii is a graphical avatar that you create with a variety of options to make it look somewhat like you (or not).  This 'Mii' then will start showing up in games that support the Mii feature (such as Wii Sports), you can make quite alot of different Mii's, and you choose one within the game(s) to represent you.  If you're connect to the net and have the Mii's Mingle option turned on, they'll 'roam' onto your friend's Wii where they can save it to their system and it (your Mii) will start showing up in their game(s) too.  Upto 8 Mii's can also be downloaded to the Wii-remote and transferred to other systems that way too.  like Internet:  the wii does NOT have a built-in network adaptor (wired), instead it has a wireless connection.  This has its pluses and minuses, that is, its fine and very easy to hook up IF you have a wireless router, if you dont have a wireless router, then you'll either have to get one, or get Nintendo's USB-WiFi adaptor that it orginally had marketed for the DS.  Once you are connected, you can befriend other friends' Wii's (once you exchange system friend codes) and such.  Later on when Nintendo gets the respective services going, you'll be able to check news and weather channels too.. and a web-browser (which is supposedly going to be free until Jun/jul '07).  The system DOES have optional parental controls for those who are concerned.  As far as 'what type of news' will show up in the news channel... no one can say at this point, we'll have to wait and see.There is also the Virtual Console and the Wii Shop..The Virtual Console (VC) is where users can download and play a variety of games from earlier systems, namely the orginal NES, the SNES, the Sega Genesis, and the TurboGrafx 16 systems.  They all cost from [...] in 'Wii points' (which are roughly 1 point=1 cent ) which can be purchased through the system or in-store via point-cards.  The Wii-shop is where you can buy these games, and/or more Wii-points, and eventually dl the browser and other utilities once Nintendo makes them available.By and large, the system is ..GREAT, and at approx.

If you are in the market for an inexpensive system, this is a good one to buy, as many of the games are readily available at relatively low prices.If you want a system that will last you many years, and if you have more money to spend, you may want to wait until the next generation of gaming system is released.  However, for a light video game player, this will be a very good buy. It doesn't come with much though. You will likely need to buy a second controller and some games, as the system itself only comes with the sports games (which are OK, but you will soon want something different to play).I recommend the Wii Play set, because it is entertaining, and has the added benefit of including an additional Wii-mote.

After less than ten minutes of installation I put Wii Sports in and was immediately pleasantly surprised. I expected simple little games, with a little motion sensing finish, but I didn't expect them to be highly addictive and fun.Wii Sports is like five games in one. For instance in Boxing you beat your first oponent and the next and they progressively become more difficult, challenging you a little bit more one after the other. I won't spoil anything else for you, but if your into fun, addictive, family games than the Nintendo Wii is for you. On the flipside, you've got the new games coming out, with a much darker finish.In short, the Wii is a sure-thing to appeal to the hard-core gamer for its innovation, as well as the casual gamer who just wants to sit down every once and a while. (Like my mother, for instance. She never plays videogames, but there she was whacking those tennis-balls!)BUY IT. IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD!And did I mention the price advantage? It's totally worth it!",

When I read the review in a PC Magazine of John Dvorak -- a noted curmudgeon -- loving this system, I was intrigued. I got the system as a gift, and I told my mom who is an avid bowler how Dvorak mentioned that the system does an honest representation of Bowling. We played it this weekend, and the whole family, from ages 6 to 87, bowled on this thing. We had a great time! The great part is that we did this in the living room, and there were no sixteen-pound balls to lug around, so we were able to play again and again.I cannot emphasize how much fun this is.

On Christmas morning I saw a bag that had a phone organizer, a CD case, and a Transformers Animated Leader Megatron and on the bottom I saw a Barnyard Wii game. Then my mom opens one up and I screamed 'You got us a Wii?' My brother spent the morning putting it together.I got a bunch of Wii games. I got Cars Mater-National, Merry Grifin's Crosswords, Transformers, and as I mentioned Barnyard. My brother got games too. The thing that all Wii's come with are: a remote, Wii Sports, and the Wii itself. I got a bunch of Wii acessories.My favorite thing to do is Wii Sports and Cars Mater-National. I have a PS2, but I won't be using it much now that I have the Nintendo Wii.This is not my first time owning a Nintendo console. I once owned a Gameboy Advance SP. The Wii and the DS have some sort of a connection.I screamed with joy when I got a Wii. Luckily for me, it wasn't a prank where there was nothing in the box as I've seen in YouTube videos. One video shows a guy holding the box giving it to his 'son', opens it and asks 'Where's my Wii?' Then he blurts that he spent $200 on the box and inserts but no Wii (it was probably in the other room). The guy gets down on his knees and rains tears.My aunt has a Wii and brings it to every family party held at my house or Grandma's house. For you Transformers fans, I hope they make a Transformer of a Wii remote. So what are you waiting for gaming fans go out now and get your Nintendo Wii.",

I love hitting home runs, taking batting practice and playing tennis.  Not a big fan of boxing, but the training is fun and funny.  I get such a kick out of the little Wii figures because they don't really have arms and legs.  I play with the Wii game nearly every night while I am waiting for my husband to get home.  I am actually toning up and getting better at the games.  I hope to get a Wii Fit Plus when they are back in stock.",

        "body": "My family is lucky or foolish enough to have a Wii, XBox 360 and now a PS3.  I can say without question that the one that brings the most joy and is the most fun for the family is the Wii.  Nintendo's decision not to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft and Sony was a wise one.  By focusing on gameplay and really nailing the wireless and motion-sensitive controllers, they have created gameplay that is addictive, incredibly fun, physical and novel.  Sure it doesn't output in HD, but with the component cable (which unfortunately costs extra) the output is 480p and is clear and DVD quality.  It is certainly enough for the majority of players.  Many members of my extended family do not play video games at all but they couldn't stop playing Wii Sports, which is wisely bundled with the console so you can play the console right away without purchasing another title.  Each person in my family has their favorite of the five games on Wii Sports, but it showcases the motion-sensitive controller and gets you used to this new type of gameplay.  My mother-in-law, who I have never seen play any video game ever, loved Wii Bowling.  My two cousins (under 11) challenged each other in boxing and stopped fifteen minutes later only because they were sweating and so exhausted that they couldn't raise their arms.  How many times does that happen while playing video games?  A huge selling point for me was the Virtual Console, the online store where you can download classic games from the original Nintendo Entertainment System, the Super NES, Sega Genesis, TurboGrafx 16 and the N64.  What a great nostalgic trip.  Once I got the wireless connection set up, I bought some Wii points and downloaded the original NES Legend of Zelda, and this past week downloaded Super Mario Bros.  Playing these games takes me back to when we got our first NES in 1986, and it has been a blast.    For $250, it is without question the best value, the most fun and the best gameplay rightnow for any age and level of experience.  I cannot recommend it more, and I have not been this excited for a game console in 20 years.",

It exceeded anything I could have expected.  The two points which sold me are 1) you have to get up off the couch and get active to play and 2) the focus isn't so much on violence, blood and killing.  I'm a senior citizen and my daughter picked this up for me.  We played it until our arms were numb and she is looking to get her own Wii so we can play on-line.  I check the daily weather and news stories on my Wii and my friends and I will soon start a bowling league.  For the price, you can't beat this system.  If I were paying 50 cents for every game I played, it would have paid for itself in a month or two.  The software selection is great and the prices are reasonable.  I rate the Wii right up there with the Internet and the ATM.  Get yours and you'll see.",

        "body": "Two words too describe the Wii:  Fun and versatile!  Obviously, this console is not about the graphics, but about the revolutionary game play and I must say, it works for us!  I've been through a dozen consoles during my lifetime (I still remember playing the real old school 'Breakout' back in the day), Ataris, Colecovisions, Nintendos, Playstations, etc...and in terms of just plain old fun, the Wii really outpaces them all because it really is a family-oriented unit.    Needless to say, I really put myself through the paces prior to buying this simply becasue I wasn't too sure what the next gaming step for our family would be.  We own a PS2 and I've been loyal to the Sony brand since the days of the PS1, but honestly, putting out $600 for a new gaming system seemed, well....just outrageous to me.  Enter the Wii.  Moderately priced at $250 (assuming you can get one at retail), it delivers a punch for the price.  Not only are the Wii games fun and interactive (our whole family plays now), but I love the Virtual Console aspect of it as well which allows me to go 'retro' now and again and play some of my favs from the day.  Just recently, we purchased Super Marios Brothers for the old NES and I'm hooked all over again!!  The Wii sports game that comes with the console is a great introduction to the Wiimote and addictive to play.  I never thought I'd have myself an in-house bowling league, but my wife and daughters play just about every night.  Obviously, Wii sports is only an sampling of what you can do with the system and I can't wait to get into some of the other games available, but we are hooked.  Even if I could stop the review there, it would be enough...but add in the wi-fi capabilities of this unit and its future potential to connect with the DS games, and I have an all around entertainment unit for our household.    In short, we love it and I am extremely happy with our purchase!",

        "body": "The Wii is the first Nintendo product i've ever owned. I was lucky to get a Wii at a local EB Games.(last piece in the shipment) I gave it to my son as his birthday gift. The whole family enjoyed it so much.  Buyer satisfaction index is way high!  My whole body ached for 3 days after over 9 hours of play in the first day. My wife also has not exercised so much in her entire life--the bowling, tennis, baseball.... man, is it fun! My daughter and son both go to a small Christian academy and they just couldn't stop sharing with their friends how much fun this game is. I sit behind them and watch them play hour after hour and cheered them when they did well, and encouraged them when defeated.  This game not only burns calories but boosted family cohesion exponentially. I see so many positive things with the Wii and the sports game included in the system. If you value family time, this is the thing to get. It's compact, it's reliable.  After using it for over 9 hours the first day, no problems and not even feeling hot on the unit.  Considering the PS3 and the Xbox 360 (i have the Xbox), all needs some kind of external cooling unit if you play extensively, it gets really hot.  On the downside, even though the Wii remote are very durable and strong, they are a bit too expensive ($40 a piece) and all the stores are still out of stock! Highly recommended and worthwhile to put a deposit in the store to pre-order it.  Nintendo, way to go!",

I can't wait for Smash Bros. and Mario Party 8 but what am I to play for now?  The console was made for both casual and hardcore gamers.  I suppose I am more of a casual player.  I never really got into Zelda: TP, TH Downhill Jam, Super Monkey Ball, or Wii Play.    I'd say Wii Sports is pretty good, but you can only play that so long.  I would no doubt buy a Wii Sports 2 if they sold it.  And they don't even have to add different games to it.  Just improve on the ones already there.  I'd gladly shell out $30 or $40.",

I have been a real couch potato for too long, and this is so much fun, I have been playing it every day for hours, especially the team tennis.  You can play one person, as I do, against the games pre-existing characters, or purchase additional remotes and play as a family.   I ordered a nice spungy mat, so as not to wear out the carpet, and to protect my feet.     Also, between tennis sets, or golfing, etc., I watch the weather around the globe, and up-to-the-minute news updates, as it is Wi-Fi enabled, and connected to my router.      In one week's time my arms are noticeably regaining a more youthful shape.  My legs and tummy, too.  It has got me up and moving and playing/feeling like a kid again.  Even my mood has been lifted.  The best part is you can move at your own pace avoiding injuries, while having a boatload of fun...  I purchased another set today (at retail price) from Circuit City for a family with a kid.

I didn't realize how high this things were in demand.      Anyways I was amazed at how small and compact the system was. Its very sleek and pure white giving it the modern look. The only problem I had at first was the sensor bar. But that was because my living room is kind of small and I needed to stand further back. Moved a little and it was fine.       Now it comes with wiisports which is one of the funest games for the wii. Which is cool and sad at the same time. There arn't many great games for the wii. The ones that are fun are cartoony and childish. And there isn't any news of any good titles coming out soon. But the saving grace would have to be super smash bros. Its very fun and you can have 3 of yours friends playing with you. Oh, and you can play with the gamecube controlers if you please.      So I would recommend the wii to families, children, or as a sweet little party machine. But for the adults or more serious gamers i would go for the 360 as it has the best selection of games out of all the systems( just make sure to get extended warrenty as I'm on xbox #4 and havn't even owned as a xbox for barely a year).",

Every game involves you to actually move around whether it's swinging your controller like a bat, bowling ball, racquet, boxing glove (this involves holding two controllers in your fist) or you name it. Gone will the days that gaming is just a sedentary experience. What a great way for young kids to play fun games while actually burning calories. Speaking of kids the Wii games tend to be family oriented so it will be much easier to find fun games that exclude all the gore/profanity(always check the ratings though).     The Wii graphics are good at best. Don't expect this console to be keeping up with the 360/PS3 because in this department it simply doesn't. This system lacks next gen graphics but that's overall ok because of the completely new direction the Wii has gone in.     My final thoughts are buy the Wii knowing that this is a family oriented console. Most popular main stream title games out there will be second rate on the Wii. Some of the finest Wii games are those made specifically for the Wii due to the completely different controls, like Wii bowling. This console really earns it weight in gold when played in a group settings.     Extra Note: The Wii Fit is really a must buy for the Wii it's going to cost an extra $90 but it's worth it.",

        "body": "For YEARS, my console gaming experience has fundamentally been about sitting around and twiddling my thumbs.    Now, to be fair, I don't have a setup for a steering wheel for my PS2, and I never owned an NES along with its light gun, Power Pad, Power Glove, and whatever else it used.    That's the point, though.  All of those devices were extra.  Game developers can't assume that a console owner is going to own some specific peripheral, so they either had to include one with a game or write the game to handle the standard controller.  So, you ended up either with a bunch of peripheral devices that only worked on a couple games apiece, or you made do with standard controllers.    Because every single Wii comes with the new controller and its do-anything capabilities, developers don't have to worry about creating & selling new hardware of their own.  They can focus instead on trying new things, and they'll know that gamers will get the right experience.    When someone picks up, say, Wii Sports for the first time and play the bowling game, they ask how to put spin on the ball.  I tell them, 'Just spin it,' and much to their surprise, it works.  Three frames later, they're bowling as easily as they do in real life.  It's just that easy, and it makes that much sense.    Brief rundown of a few of the games I've got:    Wii Sports: It's a keeper.  Work on your backspin & topspin in Tennis, score 300 in Bowling, etc.  It's got a lot of depth, and it relies on your skills as a player.    Resident Evil 4 - Wii Edition:  Holy cow.  Aim, shoot, aim, shoot.  It's much faster and more accurate than wiggling conventional controller sticks.  Playing a RE game on any other console just doesn't make sense anymore.  If you're a fan AT ALL of the RE franchise, and even if you already have this game for the Gamecube or PS2, get the Wii version; you'll never touch the older versions again.    Wario Ware - Smooth Moves:  A lot of story & dialogue -- a lot more than gameplay -- but it really is a kick.  So many of the tasks are so silly that you'll laugh out loud, even while playing alone.    The Godfather: Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  If this is indicative of where Grand Theft Auto-style gaming is going, we're in for a treat.  The first time I engaged in an in-game fight (as opposed to a tutorial), I reflexively started pressing buttons.  After a couple seconds, I remembered to just punch with the controller, and my character started beating up on the guy.  Bingo; that's how it should be done.  Grab a guy by his collar and throw him against a wall; grab him again and start punching him in the face... it's so much more satisfying to use hand motions than mere button combinations.    Need For Speed Carbon: I got this one strictly as an experiment -- I have it for the PS2, and I wanted to see what the new control scheme is really like while playing a game I already know.  I have to say that it's very, very nice.  Again, I don't have a wheel for the PS2; but after a few minutes of getting used to the steering response of the Wii controller, it makes an awful lot of sense.  Mid-corner corrections respond well, countersteering works, on and on and on.  Despite not having force feedback like a conventional wheel controller, it becomes second nature, and it's easy to 'steer where you look', as they say in car racing.  Plus, because no extra attachments are needed (although an inexpensive clip-on wheel is nice to have) and you don't have to bolt anything to a table or sit on a wheel base, it's very, very convenient.    Trauma Center - Second Opinion: Definitely a niche game, but it's gotten reviews that favor it versus the original Trauma Center for the DS, and it's quite a lot of fun.  You really start to feel the pressure as you work to save patients, and the Wii controller is perfect for the job.    The Legend Of Zelda - Twilight Princess:  Get it.  Wonderful game.  If you're a Zelda fan, you already know that this is one of the best ever; if you're not a fan,this one just might win you over.    BOTTOM LINE:  This is it, the next big thing in home video games.  It's still out of stock everywhere because it really is that good.  Expect even better things to come along as the online network gets underway and game developers refine their use of the controller.",

My Wii, in comparison, was babied, never played more than a few hours.  I will say that Nintendo's customer service seems quite good, and they're repairing it free.  Still, a month without a game console is not fun.  I thought, being Nintendo, the Wii would be ultra reliable, but Nintendo tells me that mine is a common problem.",

        "body": "With the release of the three next generation gaming consoles (XBox360, PS3, and Nintendo's Wii), the Wii was supposed to be the 'also ran' of the group.  I am now wondering if Nintendo could turn around and win the console war this round despite the higher end graphics offered by the other two.  The biggest advantage that the Wii has is price.  To get the entire console at $250 is amazing!  And I appreciate their simplicity in offering only one console instead of a core system and a higher-end system, something that aggravated me about the other two consoles.  On the innovative side, the Wii comes now with the remote and nunchunk.  I was pretty surprised while playing to learn that the remote actually has a speaker inside.  That is pretty new as well.  But the remote looks like a small TV remote and adds a new level of flexibility to gameplay.  For one, if you point at the screen then it can pretty much function as a mouse.  It can also detect if the remote tilts in one way or the other.  For instance, while bowling if you tilt the remote to the left when releasing the ball then the ball will curve left.  In boxing, if you lean to the right then the body of your boxer leans to the right to dodge a blow from your opponent.  There is a driving game where you can use the remote as a steering wheel.  Again, this is completely innovative on Nintendo's part.  One complaint I have heard about the Wii remote is that it is easy to break once you get into the game.  I can see why.  While playing baseball or golf you swing it like a bat or a club.  Also in baseball you throw it like a baseball while pitching.  Instinct almost kicks in and makes me want to let go of the remote during the pitching part of baseball.  There is a learning curve to the remote as well.  However, the Wii comes with Wii Sports to get you familiar (like how Bill Gates threw in Solitaire into Windows to help learn the mouse).  Wii Sports will not keep youentertained for long because they become quite boring after you master the use of the remote but it does do a good job of getting you over the curve.  The remotes are also in short demand right now and most games seem to have written the use of the remotes into the games as an afterthought (the largest exception being Zelda).  But I think games in the future will be written throughout with the remote and nunchunk in mind and these games are going to be amazing.  The graphics are not as impressive as what you'll see on the XBox360 and the PS3, but the DVD quality is good enough when you are more interested in playing and having fun.  Don't get me wrong, the 1080 resolution is very impressive.  But after you get into a game, the graphic difference becomes irrelevant if you are having fun.  And the Nintendo Wii is a load of fun!!  One last note.  While searching for a Wii I went to many stores (Best Buy, a few WalMarts, Target, several Game Stops and many others).  I noticed that a lot of the XBox360's and PS3's were frozen or out of order.  Very few demo machines actually worked.  But I never once saw a Wii not working though all but once had a classic controller instead of the new remote.  I've read that PS3's can overheat and the XBox360 can crash on occasion (Windows!!  Typical).  So I'm glad that the Wii comes out quite solid.  So, Wii loses in graphic capabilities but wins in price, fun, stability, and innovation.  Choose which is more important to you and then go with that decision.",

But when I try to play by myself I realize that I look like a mental patient plus I get tire of swinging my arms just for the character hit a ball.  So the way I see it the Wii is fun and innovative to a point because the technical specs are not worthy to be call next generation (looks like they just jam an improve version of the old Gamecube inside the Wii), for me it was fun to play with family and friends not when you are alone. In the contrary the way you play the games its really innovative, but to be honest it gets old really quickly.  Maybe I'm to old for this console in fact if you look at the game list, its clear that Nintendo intended this console to be for kids. I keep my Wii as a novelty or party trick if you will since I don't use it very often.Mean while I get my game on my xbox360 he understand that I just want to play High Definition, awesome graphics, online first person shooters and car racing games, all that while sitting in my lazyboy.  This is a good choice as a family fun game or for small kids, but for true gamers or people ages 16 to 35 this console will be a waste of time and money.",

        "title": "A Review for Parents/Adults Buying a System for Kids",
        "body": "I'm writing this review for people who are in the market to purchase a videogame console for others, who may not know much about videogames. I am trying to be as informative and educational as possible so that people can make a smart purchase. A disclaimer right up front, I'm writing this review to help people whom I feel might have incorrect perceptions based on mainstream media hype for the Wii console. In my apartment, I do have an Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii, and have many hours of experience will all of the systems.    What is the Wii?  -The Nintendo Wii is the successor to the Nintendo Gamecube console, and is presumably in competition with the Microsoft Xbox 360 ('X360') and Sony Playstation 3 ('PS3') consoles. However, there is considerable debate as to what degree the target market of the Wii overlaps with the target markets of the X360 and PS3. That is not to say that the X360 and PS3 are not targeting young, new, and/or female gamers, as they both are, nor that the Wii is not targeting experienced videogame players, as it is.  But there is considerable evidence, especially in the Japanese market but also in America, of people who had zero prior interest in any videogames at all, purchasing Wii systems for their interest in titles like Wii Sports, Wii Play, Wii Fit, Mario Party, and possibly other simple 'party-game' style titles. This is an important distinction to make because people, including children, who actually play videogames will often quickly grow tired of the aforementioned games because they lack any of the depth of play that has been associated with good videogames since before Nintendo released its first system in the 1980s. (so this has nothing to do with the graphics capabilities of the Wii, but the character of its popular game titles).    But aren't good games available on the Wii?  -Yes, absolutely. Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mario Galaxy, and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess are a few examples of superb videogames available exclusivelyon the Wii that exemplify the 'depth' and 'character' of videogames that I was talking about before. However, the relevant question is whether there are perhaps more and better videogames available on the X360 and PS3. To answer this question, I would have to say that yes, there definitely are. To offer objective statistics to back up this assertion, I point you to Game Rankings or another website that aggregates professional videogame reviewer scores and combines them to an overall consensus score out of 100%. Lets say that 'great' games are those that have a consensus score of 85% or greater. Using this objective metric on Game Rankings, we find that the Wii has 9 'great' games while the X360 and PS3 have 34 and 20 'great' games each respectively.    But graphics aren't everything, right?  -Yes, again that's absolutely true. In the same way that I think some Nintendo Entertainment System games from the late 1980's are better than some videogames being made now, its also true that some Wii games are better than some games being made with better graphics but overall worse gameplay for the X360 and PS3. While graphics are not everything, they're certainly something. Compare better graphics with better camera technology, special effects, and bigger production budgets in movies. Spartacus, the 1960 film starring Kirk Douglas, is a great movie. But is it better than Gladiator, the 2000 film starring Russell Crowe? Despite any feelings of nostalgia, I think most people will agree that Gladiator is the better film. In the same way, videogame developers work extremely hard to leverage the better graphics capabilities of the X360 and PS3 to make games that are overall better. The latest important trend is videogame design has been the adoption of techniques from blockbuster movies to add cinematic qualities and the feel of 'high producion values' to videogames. Start up a game of Call of Duty 4: Modern Combat, available for both the X360 and PS3, and you're put in the rearseat of a rickety passenger car, traveling a middle eastern city in the middle of warfare chaos. You watch as you speed past people in gunfights, buildings exploding out in the distance, civilians scurrying for cover, etc. The Wii simply lacks the hardware capability to pull off the same kind of scenario. Its graphics are incapable of allowing the player to 'suspend disbelief' for a real-life scenario.    In conclusion:  -The Wii is a decent system, and has several exclusive titles, predominately made by Nintendo, that videogames players would truly enjoy getting to. However, the X360 and PS3 are better systems with more and better games, and for anyone who is known to play videogames, I would always recommend an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3.",

Console - This is a great console it's lots of fun, especally in groups but also good by yourself. The graphics are not as good as a PS3 for example but they not ment be. To really enjoy this you got to get the right games like Mario Kart, Wii Sports Island, the Olympic games, any tennis game and Wii fit. If you want something for a great shoot 'um up get something else. This is great and is lots of fun for adults and children a like.Wii Sports - It's a great game in it's self Tennis and bowling is brilliant. Boxing, golf and baseball are also fun but (sometimes)can take a while to get into them. With it's scoring system you only play computer players of your standard and and that scoring systems gives something aim for.Get it",

Only problem is the graphics could be a little sharper and at least 720p for the HD world but this does not subtract from game play.  Highly recommended.",

I hooked it up a few hours before the thanksgiving feast and her parents saw it. They were so impressed they were actually eager to try it. We played some Wii tennis, bowling, and a few holes of golf (golf was FUN can you believe it?).    At the actual dinner when the guests came, my fiance's mom actually asked me to show the guests the Wii--and then they all got into it too! It was crazy, never seen this many 50 yr-olds playing video games--probably because it's not like traditional video games. One of the guests said 'This is incredible! This is too much fun!' and later he went to my fiance and told her that she has to take the Wii away from me otherwise she will never see me again.    Two days later, we tried it out at my fiance's aunt's house with her mother's side of the family. Again, her mom brought up the Wii and I hooked it up and everyone was watching or playing. Even her 9 yr-old cousin tried it and she wouldn't put it down when everyone was leaving--she was as good at the game as anyone else--Wii is this easy to use--only takes couple of tries to learn how to play. 4 player tennis and bowling action! Baseball was fun too, but only 2 players.    I mean I knew it was going to be fun for ME, but wasn't expecting it to be a huge hit across all ages. Making Miis is one of the most fun aspects of the Wii. You can make virtual avatars to use in Mii compatible games such as Wii Sports. I specialize in politicians and celebrities, including Dubya, Cheney, Hilary, Kerry, Saddam, Kim Jung Il, Michael Jackson, various Star Trek characters, etc. It's very amusing to use these fun avatars in your games: imagine tennis matches of Dubya and Cheney vs Saddam and Kim Jung Il.

        "body": "First Impressionby w0kie, Jun 20 '07It is June, 2007 and new Wii consoles are next to impossible to find either mailorder or locally. After a weeks worth of hard searching I finally located the one and only one in my town for sale at list price at a local Supercenter. My two elementary aged grandsons own a PS3 and an XBox360 respectively and both wanted a Wii.First impression: Unboxed the Wii and hooked it to a 27' Sony standard def. TV. The Wii image was crystal clear. I then turned the Wii over to my Xbox 360 owning eleven year old grandson. At first he couldn't get the remote to talk to the on screen menu but that problem was solved by relocating the light bar from the top of the TV to below the TV. This grandson had played a Wii at at friends house before and was ready, willing and able to test the box by first creating a family of Mii's. The Mii's are sort of like avatars. The Mii creation program is part of the Wii operating system. The player can make the Mii's wear different clothes, different hair styles, etc. This Mii creation is almost a game all to itself.Then it was time for the real test of Wii console. The first game on the software disk that comes with the console is Tennis.The Wii instructions, both on paper and on screen warn you VERY strongly to always have the remote control wrist strap around the player's wrist. Once my grandson started the tennis game I knew why. To hit the tennis ball the player like my grandson makes a wild arm movement with the remote. Everybody must stand back because the player needs living room space to swing their electronic tennis racket.I'm very impressed that such a capable game machine can be sold for such a fair price. I know that I've only seem a small amount, so far, of what this very affordable game machine can do. Best of all my grandkids will bring me their love when they come to visit to play Wii games.Pros:Wii brings home the family loveCons:Out of stock everywherePros:   Wii brings home the family love    Cons:   Out of stock everywhere  ",

        "title": "It's the Newest Sensation!  (by Laura)",
        "body": "At a time where the Playstation 3 was too pricey, and the XBOX 360 was too boring, the refreshingly revolutionary Wii came out: and, let me tell you, it's one of the BEST gaming systems out there!  In this review, I will describe the Wii's strongest and weakest points, starting with the stronger:    1.  Revolutionary motion controls.  Though there are a few 'traditional' games, most of the Wii's games feature controls based on movement (e.g. swinging your arms to throw a punch, or pointing to select an option).  These controls are AWESOME!  They work pretty well, even before the fancier things like Wii Motion Plus and the Wii Balance Board came out (each sold separately).  With motion on your side, this system is also probably the most calorie-burning game system on the market today.  The motion controls make games a MUCH more immersive experience; like you're playing them instead of watching them!  VERY revolutionary indeed!    2.  Easy to set up.  I won't lie: this is the first game system I managed to set up without any parental assistance.  Just make sure that you find the right TV channel that will show the Wii screens (for me, it's Video 2, using the input button; but it probably varies).  Once you get the hang of it, it will only take about ten to fifteen minutes to set up before play, if you choose to take it down.  In other words, the fun starts almost instantly!    3.  FUN games!  Many great games have come out for the Wii since it's release (e.g. 'Sonic Unleashed,' 'Super Smash Brothers Brawl,' 'Sonic and the Black Knight,' 'Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games,' etcetera; each sold separately).  In fact, 'Wii Sports' alone is a great game, and it comes WITH the Wii!  Buying a Wii is basically like buying a mine that holds gold; you're going to get a LOT of rich experiences out of it!    4.  Gamecube game compatibility!  All of the great games you can play on Gamecube can be played ON the Wii!  There are some GREAT Gamecube games to boot!  So, if you buya Wii, you're basically buying TWO great systems at once!  How's that for a deal?    5.  Most inexpensive of the newest systems.  The price has even come down since I bought it!  At the price it is now, it is MORE than remarkable!    6.  Decent graphic capabilities.  I've heard many people complain that the graphics for the Wii games aren't any good; those people obviously haven't played games like 'Sonic Unleashed.'  You buy that game and tell me: do the graphics stink?  NO way!  True, they may not be the VERY best graphics on the market, but that's basically just splitting hairs; the graphics still hold their own, even when compared to the other latest systems.    7.  Fun features!  The Wii is capable of interacting with the internet to allow multiplayer capabilities through online resources, weather updates, shopping, and more!  It can also do stuff with pictures, but I've never explored it; this thing has thousands of features, but, alas, most of it is useless if you don't have Wi-Fi.  Still, if you're internet savvy, this is one of the BEST systems to have!  My favorite non-internet feature is creating the Miis (basically little computer people for some games); it's AWESOME to create an in-game version of yourself, and your family!  That feature alone will keep you entertained for at least a couple of hours!    Well, that's all I can think of on the great features; and, trust me, there are a LOT of good features with this system!  Still, it has it's weaknesses; and, while I don't think they're deal-breakers, each buyer should be aware of the system's limitations:    1.  Questionable durability.  Though I have never tested the durability for myself, the Wii just doesn't feel the strongest; while it may be able to take a hit or two (I don't know; I've never dared to try), I wouldn't throw it on a hard surface, drop it, or hit it in any way shape or form.  Because I don't trust its durability, I never use the stand it comes with (which can make the system stand vertically) prefering, instead, to lay it down horizontally.  At least it won't fall apart the second you touch it, and it doesn't overheat easily if you follow the directions on ventilation (trust me, if it did, mine would be dead by now); but, again, no hard hits.    2.  LOTS of parts.  Unlike a PS3 or an XBOX 360, which probably only come with a remote control and a few wires, the Wii has many parts: a sensor bar (for reading the motions), wireless remote controls (which can easily get lost if kept away from the system itself), and a couple of wires (for audio and visuals) all come with the package.  It's easy to forget items like the sensor bar; and, guess what, without the sensor bar you can't play as the Wii loses the ability to sense motion.  Just something to make note of.    3.  The Wii remote runs on AA batteries, because it is wireless.  This means you'll throw more money down the tubes keeping the Wii remote powered in order to play.  Have some Energizer batteries handy: you'll need them.  Constant play will wear out Wii remote batteries in about two to three days (six to a week if you only play only an hour or two a day).    4.  Synchronizing is needed for multiple controls.  In order to add controllers and, therefore, multiplayer gameplay, you have to do this thing called synchronizing: basically, making it so the system can sense the movement of the remote.  While I've never done it (I'm a mostly single player), the process looks confusing compared to simply plugging in the controller and starting.  Also, speaking of multiplayer, bear in mind that the system itself only comes with ONE Wii remote and ONE Nunchuk; you'll need to buy more remotes and nunchuks separately if you wish to engage in multiplayer.    Conclusion: well, that's that.  The Wii IS oriented on family fun and exercise: so, get your family together and play!  However, if you're mostly a single player (like I am), don't stress: there's a lot of great things for you too!  Overall, the Wiiis one of the BEST consoles of the times; and, maybe, the decade!",

        "body": "Easy to set up. Network connection was easy.   The Remotes and Nunchucks are a bit spendy when you have to buy three more of each. The Wii usually only comes with one set. Altho, you can hold off on the Nunchucks as there aren't very many multipayer games where you can use three or more people that need the Nunchucks. Usually just two people need it. And then you'll have to buy the Game Pad to play the older games if you are used to using it. But then some of the Wii's are now coming with the rubber 'protectors' already on the Remotes so that's great.     A blast when playing with more then one person on some of the games. We haven't really bought many games for it as the grand kids are just getting to the point of being able to play now. The attention span just isn't there yet. The games we do have are great to play.",

        "body": "I am a middle-aged female who has been curious about the Wii for several years. I was finally able to purchase it at a very good price but still had my doubts. For one thing, I was worried about how much space it would take up. I HATE clutter, and I did not want a bunch of stuff sitting around. No problems here. The unit itself is very small, and the accessories can be neatly stored in the entertainment center. I also worried about the physical space I'd need since our family room is cozy. Yes, we've hit a couple things, but after readjusting we seem to be fine.    Oh, I was also worried about installation. Not a problem. It installed quickly and easily and began working seamlessly.    This unit came with the Wii sports package. We got the Wii about four days ago and have been playing with it for hours every day. It's a good workout too. Yes, I was a bit sore after playing the first day, but that just tells me I'm out of shape (already knew it) and need to keep playing to get in better shape.    In my opinion, the two best games are bowling and tennis. I found the boxing to be great for stress reduction, but it's much more taxing than the other games. Perhaps when I'm in better shape I'll find it more enjoyable. I haven't quite figured out how to do well in the baseball game, but again time will tell.    Bowling and tennis, however, are lots of fun and provide an excellent workout.    I am very pleased with this purchase. I feel strongly that I will be in much better shape in a year with the help of this game.",

Well, they're mostly right and already explain most all of the positive features ad nauseam.I'll just tell you that I purchased 2 units for Christmas last year for the game room and for the family room.  The kids love it; the games we've played are mostly 'Very Good' to 'Excellent'.The units come in handy for family gatherings as well.  Everyone can play the Wii-Sports games and several other party-game titles.  It's the modern version of playing charades.The other cool feature we like is the Wii acts like a computer.  You connect your Wii to your home's Wi-Fi signal and you can send & receive email, surf the net, send memos, send Wii points as gifts, send & receive photos, as well as participate in Voting Polls (national and international).It's a seriously fun unit and worth the $250.00.",

Over the years though I've discovered they are a lot like action movies though, same plot, often enjoyable, but fairly repetitive and predictable.  I bought a Wii in hopes of experiencing different types of games.  And so far I have been pleasantly surprised.  I never thought I'd want to play tennis every day, but it's a great little 20 minute break from work to get me re-energized and get me out of my chair (the joys and perils of the home office).  Ultimately I think this system has great potential and I hope the game designers take advantage of the new possibilities.  It's been exactly what I was looking for in a game system, fun.",

The games are $5 for a NES game, $8 for a SNES and $10 for a N64.  They will also be selling Sega Genesis games and Turbograf.  Well worth the couple of dollars for hours of fun.

However we haven't seen any groundbreaking games that change the game play experience in any of the new, next generation systems. Nintendo is betting that the change won't be graphical but instead based on new peripherals such as the motion sensing Wii remote.    This remote shows ingenuity, but is not as impressive as one would think. It doesn't seem that the Wii Remote senses true 3d motion. What is meant by that (Check my Amazon profile because I discuss it on my website.) is when you swing it doesn't record the 3d position of your arm, instead it just records the swing as a slash motion in most games. That is so that when you swing you sword in Zelda: Twilight Princess the character (Link) just swings his sword. It is not like you are involved in a 3d sword battle. FPS shooters are another area where a standard controller is needed. It is too difficult to navigate the area.    The system does has its strengths. It is the best system for kids. It is the cheapest system. And Nintendo is known for making some of the best games. But for sports, online, and FPS games the X-box 360 is the better choice.",

The fitness test is fun to see where you rate in fitness every day.  I've found that I am not a bad golfer, although I think folks would cringe if I was actually out on the green.    Wii has also been great fun for my Big Brothers Big Sister 'Little' and I to play together.  She is an awesome bowler for being only 10.      I just bought Boom Blox and I've been learning how to play it.  It's only throwing, so if you want an all-around aerobic fitness routine, definitely try the sports package (golf, baseball, tennis, boxing, bowling).    P.S.

Not only is it engaging for people who generally don't like video games, but it delivers the gameplay a seasoned gamer wants. With titles like Mario Strykers, Super Mario Galaxy, and Guitar Hero III Nintendo competes with all the other gaming systems currently ou-there. It's affordable, and amazing fun! The internet capabilities allow me to play with friends all over the world and it's easy to use. I recommend this gaming system for anyone in college! It's a social system that the whole room can enjoy! The backwards capabilities is really nice to because I'm on a budget and cannot afford all fthe new games (lucky for me my roommate works at gamestop) so it's great that I can buy cheap, used gamecube games! Rock on Nintendo! I LOVE MY Wii!!!",

        "body": "I first tried out the Nintendo Wii in mid-2008--playing such games like Wii Sports and Wii Play. It wasn't until Christmas of that same year when I finally came to own a Wii. To be completely honest, I was very impressed with the Wii's ability to detect my movements simply with the flick of the Wii controller.When I first looked at the console itself, I noticed it was extremely tiny compared to the Playstation 2 or the Xbox 360. At the same time, however, it is much heavier than it looks--as Nintendo made use of every single space they could find in this system.I've always seemed like the kind of person who couldn't sit still while playing a game--and this system only quenches my thirst to move while playing games. Games like Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Colors, and Godzilla Unleashed all require me to move my body in order to emerge victorious in the game.While it is a pleasure to know that this console gives me the ability to interact with my games through movement, older Nintendo fans may be pleased to know that you can insert and play Nintendo GameCube games thanks to the Wii's backwards compatibility with its predecessor. All you need to do this is a GameCube controller, a memory card, and a GameCube game itself. For those of you who want to go even FURTHER into Nintendo's past, you have the option to hook up your Nintendo Wii to the Internet and go to the 'Wii Shop', where you can buy many old games for the NES, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, and much more.Overall the Nintendo Wii is a fantastic home console. Even though its day are numbered and it is about to be replaced by the more powerful Wii U, I cannot tell you how much fun I have had with this console.",

And I only played the sports games that came with the system.I started off playing boxing, which was alright, but then it got really involved. Batting practice blew me away; I had to bend my knees and step into the swing. When I practiced hitting to a certain location, it was a drill I never once did in years of sleepaway camp or gym class.Sony and Microsoft were focusing on building the next best game systems, and they probably have (I've played Xbox 360 but not PS3). Yet with the Wii, Nintendo did something else entirely. They created an interactive experience, something you'd wait on line to try at a World's Fair.I know I'm slow in saying it, yet with game systems, I'm hardly an early adopter; at home I have the original Nintendo Entertainment System from the 80s, still working (Dr. Mario's the current favorite). Despite many thoughts of upgrading over the past two decades, this is the first time I've ever really thought it's worth it.All I'm left wondering now is how the heck Nintendo did it.",

It was one of the best times in years that we spent as an entire family and is a must have.I know that graphically this game system doesn't compare with the more expensive PS3 and Xbox systems. That said, the Wii is really geared toward the WHOLE FAMILY having fun together and it accomplishes this with flying colors!",

Everything about it is just easy to use, even for someone who doesn't game much.  Plus, it's awesome that it connects to the internet and you can communicate with your friends, can access the weather and all sorts of other wonderful features.  It by far exceeds any other console that I've seen.  We own just about every other console that has been put on the market and I would trade them all for this one.  Highly, highly recommended.

It is truly amazing to have a controller respond to your every movement, and I love the fact that you can purchase games that require you to be active to play them.  What really surprised me is that I've been able to find some games that my 3 year old can play with minimal assistance (who knew the child would be so good at darts?)  What's more, I have brought the system over to my parent's house, and my 60 year old mother has found games that SHE enjoys playing!At a price point far below the other next-gen systems out there, with features that make it unique from any other system, I highly recommend the Wii as a system that the entire family can easily use and enjoy.",

        "body": "I bought this used a few years ago towards the end of the Wii's life and got a good price for it. The Wii system had a handful of games that I liked and enjoyed playing. The style of play was innovative for the time and was good for casual sports or workout type games(still good for an occasional workout). But the overall choice of games for me was a bit limited and many of the games released towards the end were largely forgettable. Still a fun system for families(or folks who aren't normally dedicated gamers) to enjoy together.",

Wii Sports (the disc included) has tennis, golf, bowling, baseball, and boxing...all played interactively. No more couch potato video game systems!The Wii can even pick your internet connection wirelessly if you have a router. This allows you to surf the net and connect WiiConnect24.  The Wii is inexpensive compared to the PS3 and Xbox360, but it worth so much more when it comes to bringing your family together to play and getting your body into some physical movement!",

        "body": "I haven't bought a game console since Pong, so this purchase was a bit out of character for me. But I wanted to find something that would motivate me to be more active. The concept behind Wii was just what I needed.I order the Wii and Wii Fit Plus with a Balance Board a few days ago, and both came within a matter of days. I will review Wii Fit Plus in another review, but I wanted to review the Wii and say how please I am with the game console. The Wii comes with some simple games that I would say do more to demo the console than to be serious games, but they are still fun (at least those that I played.The hook up is simple: attach the power cord, audio video cable and the infrared 'sensor.' The remote is already synced with the console. (New remotes require an extra sync process, but it's not difficult.)The only disappointment is that the games are not very costomizable. Tennis can be played with one to four real players, but playing with one real player still results in a doubles game with three automated players. It looks like the real player in this case always gets the ball to return, so it's a little like playing a singles game, but the automated partner still swings occasionally (and misses) and that is a little distracting.It was still fun, however, and a good cardio workout.The Wii will let you cheat, and some have given the console low marks for that account. For example instead of swinging with your arm while playing tennis, you can make gentle wrist snaps, and the Wii won't be the wiser. But this is just a game after all, and it requires a little imagination. Forget about the cheats, and play it right, and you will be a lot more active than you were when watching your favorite soap.",

        "body": "This system is beyond all my expectations, and they were high, believe me.  The wii-mote is so intuitive and works so well, you are immersed in the game like never before.  I personally like the fitness challenge on Wii Sports, it is nice to see your progress.  Also, Zelda is pretty awesome.   I haven't taken advantage of the Wii channel yet, but I definitely will when the games I want become available. On a side bar....you people who pay inflated prices to get these systems realize that you're taking a HUGE chance and could be shooting yourself in the foot....right?  Case in point:  While I was attempting to get a Wii for my Brother-in-Law's family, I spoke to clerks in Gamestop and Best Buy about all the new systems.  BOTH places had their BRAND NEW Playstation 3 break down within one hour and one week respectively.  Now, lets pretend you bought a PS3 at a retailer...your money would be refunded, or they would replace the system.  NOW lets say you paid some ridiculous amount on E-Bay or Amazon, guess how much money you will be refunded???  (the cost of the system new, IF you're lucky because the person selling the system couldn't be held responsible for manufacturing flaws).  Simple economics, unless you have the money to just throw away, why don't you just wait to get it from a retailer?  As wonderful as the Wii is, I wouldn't justify paying more than the MSRP.",

        "body": "Wow.  Nintendo has finally come up with a gaming console that can be appreciated by both genders and all ages.  From middle schoolers to senior citizens, everyone can find something to love about Wii.Although most people will want to buy accessories such as extra controllers and new games, the Wii is great to play right out of the box.  The basic console comes with Wii Sports game (a selection of sports -- tennis, baseball, golf, and bowling) with its various skill levels and challenges; a wireless hand controller with wrist strap; a nunchuk controller; batteries; a wireless receiver, and the necessary cables to hook it up.  Most gamers will want, at a minimum, an extra handset and possibly the charger with rechargeable batteries. Because Wii Sports has so much included within the single game disk, extra games, while great to add, won't be necessary at first.For set-up, you'll need a space on top of your television for the slender, 9 1/2 inch long wireless bar that will pick up the movements and input from the remote controller.  You'll also need LOTS of room for arm swinging and back and forth movement (which will be unintentional, especially if you're used to playing the sports in real life.)  Don't underestimate the warnings!  Inevitably, someone playing Wii will cream a hand or knock the dog out or hit someone else in the nose.  Make sure the playing area is free of all obstacles and that everyone not playing knows to steer clear.  Even people who exercise regularly run the risk of tennis elbow and/or sore muscles.An extra note about Wii Sports since the game is a large part of a gamer's introduction to the medium:  the really cool part of the interface is the way the Wii senses and translates movement.  You can hook a bowling bowl and put slice on a tennis ball, all with the specific movements you use. The game has a training area that goes beyond the mere tutorial and into actual methods of doing the sports.  You can also test for your 'Wii Fitness Age' once a day.Although the Wii is difficult to come by at this writing, I suspect it will become more available a month or two after the holidays.  Definitely pick one up. You won't regret it.Age' once a day.      Although the Wii is difficult to come by at this writing, I suspect it will become more available a month or two after the holidays.
