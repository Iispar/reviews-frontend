        "body": "All that really needs to be said is that this is GTA with new scenery and a slightly more user-friendly design that doesn't require you to drive for ten minutes from place-to-place.Even now, Rockstar can't seem to get simple third-person controls right. They just can't do it. Nor can they get people to care about their stupid stories that do nothing but interrupt the whole point of GTA: Cause havoc. Instead, starting with the most insulting bang that was GTA IV (because what the GTA really needed was mandatory darts and hanging out with idiot characters who aren't at all likable, not that silly 'sandbox' idea of doing whatever you want, when you want, and how you want), they continue to make very slight changes to a formula that they're actively ruining with each new release. Somehow, for some reason, they still sink money into everything we couldn't care less about, especially story.If you play GTA for the story, you need to see a doctor. Games with stories are out there, and they don't stifle all the action like GTA loves to do, which completely dropped the ball when it came to focusing on its roots, instead turning it into a linear RPG with typical under-par Rockstar writing.Not quite as insulting as the disaster that was IV, which was, without the possibility of debate except by total lunatics who have no idea what they're talking about, a massive step down from San Andreas in every single way besides scenery.The GTA series is a lot like Madden. Minor changes not necessarily for the better or worse, just changes made because they need to put new features on the product, while deliberately avoiding making the game 'perfect', because they know people will buy this garbage, anyway.At least Vice City is $4.99 on Android. It's hard to beat that, especially since it's a superior game to IV and now V. Awful. Anyone still following this series really need to stop Rockstar from not needing to care. Let's face it, they're a bad developer. They ruin game after game because they can't make quality. They can't get it right, anywhere.Of course, they don't need to get it right, because people see a new Roman numeral next to 'Grand Theft Auto', and that's the only selling point they need to keep players playing bad games. It works, apparently, so keep it up, Rockstar. You're doing great to fool people who have no pattern recognition, just like Madden fans and anyone who, understandably, was disappointed that Starcraft 2 was simply not as good as the original. If the formula is a money-maker, why change it?If you said something along the lines of, 'Because...uh, it's GTA!' That's exactly right.More trash from Rockstar. Wonderful. Just, stay away, because they're still one of the most over-hyped developers of all time next to Capcom. Bravo for the money you make, Rockstar--even if you don't know how to develop a proper game, at least you can sell with the best of them. And that's all that really matters to any company on the planet that survives for more than a few months.",

The world feels way too alive to be a video game, the characters are so well developed and executed, the game world is just phenomenal and massive. The graphics are insane and the car customization is great (I wish you could put stacks on diesel trucks but oh well). The game's 3 main characters have such great chemistry. Not to sound too cliche, but Trevor is my favorite. You can tell the voice actors took time in reality to become great friends and to get to know each other. Every character besides them are also well integrated. The voice acting is top notch, and that only adds to the incredibly fun story mode that'll have you crying of laughter and itching to know what'll happen next in the wild world of Trevor, Michael and Franklin.

        "body": "I guess if you enjoy spending 90% of your time &#34;getting there&#34; and only 10% actually doing something you might like it. Seriously, typically the program spawns your character almost as far away as possible from available missions, so you have to spend about 30% of your time just getting to where you enter a mission. After you enter, typically, other things are required which take even more driving (or flying or boating) before reaching a point where some actual action starts -- another 30% shot. Then you have literally a FEW minutes of actual &#34;action&#34; followed by yet more traveling in order to &#34;get away&#34; -- 10% and 30% respectively. Nothing more fun than driving around, I always say!  In between, you get to do such fun things as mop a floor, practice yoga, go to marriage counseling, play tennis, archery, train a dog, play the stock market, etc, etc -- more &#34;fun&#34; than a barrel of monkeys! But isn't this supposed to be an &#34;action&#34; game? It's more like &#34;Sims goes to Hollywood.&#34;  They go to the trouble of building this huge map but there's practically nothing to do on it. The cops hardly exist anymore. In the previous GTA, cops were everywhere and doing almost anything was likely to set them after you. In V, they pop up after crimes but you practically NEVER see them while simply cruising.  They've given characters &#34;special powers&#34; and they by enable you to switch between characters but this does little more than complicate the game -- particularly in some missions where you are required to change characters at different points in the action.  There's only one interesting character and that's Trevor. I don't even remember the name of the other white guy because he was BORING. And the black guy is simply embarrassing -- a never ending stream of &#34;ghetto talk&#34; that would sound more authentic coming from Justin Bieber.  Finally -- BUGS. I have NEVER had a game with so many problems loading, lagging, crashing, etc, etc. I never finished the game because for a &#34;movie premiere,&#34; the character was supposed to get a tux; unfortunately, the character could never get the door to the store to open to buy the tux and could not bypass the mission -- &#34;Rockstar is aware of the problem and is seeking a solution.&#34; Well, that's nice. In the meantime, I'll go find a game with more action and less driving!",

        "title": "Boring gameplay and horrible controls make for a disappointing game",
        "body": "Against my recommendations, my wife purchased this for my teenage son, who is now 15.  If you are a parent and thinking about purchasing a Grand Theft Auto title for your kids, don't.  This game has gone to new heights to pack as much sex, violence, swearing, and drugs into it that it possibly can, and most of this content has nothing whatsoever to do with the gameplay.  They might as well have packaged the game with a porno magazine and a packed hash pipe.Apparently, all of the questionable content was included in order to punch-up the otherwise boring and tedious gameplay.  The vast majority of your time in story mode is comprised of mindlessly driving across large expanses from one location to another, and climbing and running around on foot.  Occasionally you will encounter combat, which generally involves &#34;shoot these guys that hide behind boxes and occasionally pop their heads up.&#34;  The game even aims for you, so you can basically accomplish these scenes with your eyes closed.  The rest of the game is drive here, climb that, talk to this guy.Like most of the GTA series, the control in this game is among the worst I've ever encountered.  On-foot movement is extremely awkward and difficult, and your character will frequently misstep, fall over, and lay on the ground for several seconds.  Driving is equally frustrating, as any significant turning or braking will make your car spin out of control, at which point it slides uncontrollably down the road for a cartoonishly long distance.This game features what is absolutely the worst multiplayer mode I have ever played in any game, ever.  You create a character, and are then dumped into the street with a pistol and no money.  You do jobs, or performe mundane tasks to earn small amounts of money.  Both the jobs and tasks use the formulas &#34;steal this,&#34; &#34;kill these guys,&#34; and &#34;kill these guys then steal this.&#34;  Also, there are race modes that you can play against other players, which really highlights the aforementioned weaknesses in the driving gameplay.You do jobs to get money and level up, and leveling up unlocks weapons and car modifications that have mostly been available in story mode since the first minute you started playing.  Weapons, ammo, and everything else in multiplayer mode cost a ridiculous amount, but older players have endless amounts of money thanks to an earlier game exploit that is now patched.  So, most of the existing players have unobtainable super-equipment, and now having no other goals to accomplish in multiplayer mode, spend all of their time eradicating the pistol-toting legitimate players with their arsenals of RPGs, miniguns, attack helicopters, and tanks.  Brilliantly, the game respawns you 20 feet from where you last died, so chains of 10 and 20 back-to-back deaths are not uncommon as you try to get away from the near-invincible superplayers.So what does Rockstar do to avoid you getting mercilessly slaughtered in multiplayer mode?  They put in a &#34;safe mode,&#34; whereby you are unable to be shot or blown up by other players, but your weapons are disabled.  Not only does disabling your weapons prevent you from accomplishing missions, but while the other players can't shoot or blow you up directly, they CAN kill you by running you over, and they can blow up any vehicle that you are in or close to, killing you instantly.  Meanwhile, your weapons are disabled and you are unable to defend yourself or accomplish your objectives.  Despite this, I have somehow managed to climb several levels in the game, and well...it just doesn't get better.The game gets one and a half stars for single player story mode, zero stars for multiplayer mode, and negative five stars for anybody who is under 18 years old.  Take the money you would have spent on this game, fold it into paper airplanes, and throw them off of a balcony into a crowd.  I guarantee that will giveyou more enjoyment and excitement than playing any aspect of this game will.",

        "title": "Overall great experience, but missions left something to be desired",
        "body": "I love Grand Theft Auto. I've pre-ordered every GTA game since Vice City, and I believe that Rockstar has given players a vastly improved and unique experience with each subsequent GTA game.I REALLY want to give into the hype and rate GTA V a 10/10, but I can't do that. After playing the game to 100% completion, my overall rating of GTA V is an 8/10. My hope is that through reading this review, you'll understand why I'm one of the few who rated GTA V below a perfect score. Below I've rated each major aspect of GTA V, with abbreviated bullets for each section and more detailed commentary for those willing to read below each sub-score.Overall score: 8/10MISSIONS-My primary complaint about GTA V is the lack of fun missions--there are too many 'filler' missions that don't really serve much of a purpose, and they aren't particularly entertaining.-Main story missions aren't as action-packed or meaningful until the final quarter of the game--too little too late.-Much-hyped heist missions are too few and far between, although the last couple of heists are very fun.-Most heist missions and preparation missions aren't as exciting as you'd expect.Score: 6/10Comments: The missions are the bread-and-butter of every GTA game. I was fairly disappointed with the lack of truly fun missions in this game, and I felt that it was a definite downgrade from the high quality missions of San Andreas and GTA IV. A substantial number of missions feel dull and don't fully utilize the environment or weapons to the extent that they could. The much-hyped 'heist' missions were also surprisingly underwhelming. Not counting the prologue, there are only six heists throughout the entire game, which feels like too little, since some of the earlier heists are pretty straightforward. The heist preparation missions are also very simple and boring for the most part--I feel that a huge opportunity was lost on these missions. The qualityof the missions increases significantly in the final quarter of the game to what I would consider GTA-level expectation, but this occurs too little too late. The final mission itself felt like a big let-down, considering that the finale missions in all other previous GTA games have been so great.STORY-The main story is far too fragmented and uninteresting until very late in the game.-Main characters are bland except for Trevor; too many superficial side characters who have no real purpose.-Lack of primary antagonist gives the story a directionless feel.-Voice acting is top-notch; script is very well-done.Score: 7/10Comments: The folks at Rockstar almost always tell a phenomenal story in all of their games, with top-notch writing and voice-acting. Although GTA V retains some of these high-quality elements, the decision to split the story amongst three characters has diluted the game. GTA V is the first game in the series in which I did not care one way or the other what happened to any of the main characters at any point throughout the entire game. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin are--for the most part--cookie-cutter criminals, with a notable exception in Trevor, who was the only real 'spark' for me in the game. The voice actors, as always, are very talented; they certainly do the best job that they can giving life to what is otherwise a mostly uninteresting cast. My major complaint is that the story of GTA V feels directionless: There is no primary antagonist that really stands out, and the conflicts and dynamics between the three main characters were just not enough to keep me interested.WORLD-Easily the best GTA world in the series--extremely expansive, dynamic environments with seemingly infinite amounts of things to do and places to explore.-Visuals are gorgeous and extremely varied, from draw-dropping views of Los Santos from the summit of Mount Chiliad to the many wilderness areas ofSan Andreas.-High level of interactivity with the people of Los Santos makes for exciting random encounters with often interesting results.-Los Santos is an extremely accurate recreation of Los Angeles--Rockstar researchers have definitely done their homework in creating a virtual city that's really close to the real deal.Score: 10/10Comments: The world/environment in GTA V is the most breath-taking open world that I've ever encountered in any game, which is why it deserves a perfect score. The level of variation in the urban jungle of Los Santos and the sprawling forest/mountain areas is truly a sight to behold. One particular aspect I loved was the vast amount of 'vertical space' in GTA V compared to its predecessors. GTA IV felt very flat, but GTA V takes full advantage of elevation--when you reach the summit of Mount Chiliad, it truly feels like you're standing atop a massive mountain. The Rockstar team has also done a stellar job recreating a very accurate architectural, organizational, and demographic model of Los Angeles. The pain-staking detail and polish of Los Santos and surrounding areas cannot be ignored, and the team at Rockstar that spent months (possibly years) working to make this happen deserves huge kudos for their efforts. Beyond the amazing visuals, the world itself is the most interactive of the series. Random events occur when not on missions that will prompt you to either intervene and meet interesting characters and/or gain a reward or ignore. There are a huge number of these events that occur throughout your exploration. They may be as simple as hunting down a wallet thief and either keeping the money or returning it to the victim, and some of these encounters become much more complicated, feeling like actual side missions in and of themselves. These random events inject GTA V's world with a lot of excitement from the uncertainty of their encounter. If there is any complaint regarding the world, it's that the missions did not utilize the world to the fullest extent. One example of this is the military base, known as Fort Zancudo. I was fully expecting a mission that involved infiltrating or even attacking Fort Zancudo in some way, but this never happens throughout the game on a mission.CONTROLS/SPECIAL FEATURES:-Some significant changes to controls that will take hard-core GTA fans time to acclimate.-Switching between characters is seamless--injects much-needed variety into many missions.-Very fun to reap benefits of upgradeable stats and character special abilities.-Fun to replay some missions when switching to different characters to try new strategies, although the game often makes it too obvious which character the player should switch to for optimal results.Score: 9/10Comments: The controls are solid, but there are some changes that will take GTA fans some getting used to. For instance, switching weapons feels a little awkward, even after acclimating to the controls, and I often found myself still equipping the wrong weapon when in a tight situation even halfway through the game. That being said, once you've worked the kinks out, GTA V handles very nicely, and the cover and combat system is essentially the same as GTA IV. One of the coolest features of GTA V is the ability to switch between the three different characters both on and off missions. I will say that character switching while on missions was a little under-utilized--the game generally holds your hand and tells you which character to switch to when on a mission, which saps the joy out of trial-and-error and discovering the best strategies on your own. In the open world, switching to a different character can often lead to exciting and unexpected events. For example, when switching from Franklin to Trevor, you might find yourself taking control of him right in the middle of a two-star wanted level, or you might find him waking up drunk in a random alley.This sort of uncertainty adds a bit of excitement to the game. Special abilities are a great addition to GTA V. Each character has a unique special ability activated by pressing R3 and L3 at the same time, and the duration of these abilities can increase if a player uses them frequently and to good effect. These special abilities make combat much more fun, giving the player more options for taking out and evading enemies.VEHICLES-Most varied and numerous vehicle selection in any GTA game yet.-Vehicle handling/controls is much improved over GTA IV--driving is finally 'fun' again.-Customization options are rampant, but not really practical until late in the game due to high cost.-Vehicle damage physics are somewhat of a downgrade from GTA IV.Score: 9/10Comments: Vehicles and planes are now much more numerous than ever before, but the biggest improvement is the more arcade-like handling in GTA V's vehicles compared to GTA IV. One of my few criticisms of GTA IV was the very sluggish handling of any and every vehicle in the game. Driving cars felt like riding boats, and riding actual boats felt like riding barges. This is now an issue of the past, as GTA V had struck a perfect balance in vehicle handling between GTA: San Andreas and GTA IV. The customization options are also incredible; however, I found myself unable to take full advantage of many of these prohibitively expensive options until the end of the game when they are almost useless. Although driving/piloting vehicles is very fun in GTA V, vehicle damage can be strange and frustrating at times. This is the first GTA game in which cars do not often explode, even after taking extensive damage. Sometimes I found myself in a nice new stolen Comet, only to hit a guard rail or another vehicle at a high speed, which ended up bending my front tires to the point that I could not drive it at all. Moments like these are somewhat rare, but common enough to irritate players when they do occur.WEAPONS-The biggest and best selection of weapons in any GTA series.-High degree of customization for each weapon is a long overdue feature.-Shooting range challenges offer easy way to upgrading shooting stats and are more fun than many of the missions.-Most missions do not allow player to use high-powered weapons to maximum effect, which can be frustrating.Score: 9/10Comments: The weapons in GTA V are phenomenal, by far the best in the series, but they are somewhat underutilized throughout the missions. The minigun is back, along with a wider selection of all weapon types. The Jerry can is a fun new addition ideal for would-be pyromaniacs out there, and sticky bombs and tear gas are very fun to use. One big problem: given the lack of extended shooting/action sequences in many missions, many of the weapons feel over-powered and under-utilized. It's not until the last quarter of the game that you really start to feel like each weapon starts to get really good use out of all of your best guns.MONEY-Money is very difficult to obtain in significant quantities throughout most of the game, even after several heists.-GTA V stock market is a fun new feature--players can also influence stocks through various actions in and outside of missions.-Properties can be purchased and yield weekly income, but the vast majority of the affordable properties throughout three quarters of the game do not pay much.-Overall a constant struggle to obtain meaningful amounts of cash, and by the end when you finally become super-rich it has no more use.Score: 8/10Comments: Money is very tough to get in high quantities in this game, much more so than any other GTA game. Unlike most previous GTA entries, the vast majority of missions in GTA V pay nothing or very little. This is clearly intentional, as Rockstar wanted to make the pursuit of wealth a key theme in GTA V. However, this takes away from the game at several points. It's very frustrating in particular that the best properties that yield the most money are prohibitively expensive until after the final mission, at which point you really don't need the properties. The lack of easily obtainable money also hurts the ability to purchase and fully utilize vehicle customization options, which feels more like bad design than anything else. Playing the stock market is fun, and influencing it through actions in the game and exploiting the aftermath of these actions to their maximum potential by investing in the right stocks at the right time is highly rewarding and can yield huge riches.COPS-A lot harder to evade than in GTA IV, which is both good and bad.-No longer able to cheaply lose wanted level by going to sleep/saving; again both good and bad.-No 6-star wanted level--I believe the first GTA game without this?-Overall cops are much more effective and relentless at pursuing you in GTA V.Score: 9/10Comments: It just wouldn't be GTA without a great police chase, and GTA V certainly delivers on that. Losing even one star can be a huge hassle, a huge contrast to GTA IV where players could easily lose three stars without too much trouble. Once you leave the cops' immediate notice, you need to stay away from their patrol awareness cones (reminds me of Metal Gear Solid radar) for an extended period of time before they stop pursuing you. You are also unable to switch characters or save for any easy way out of the wanted level, so this makes evading police even more challenging. As a plus (or minus), the military will not pursue you unless you directly attack Fort Zancudo.MUSIC-Very subjective, but in my opinion the music selection is one of the weakest of the series.-Huge variety of stations and music genres should appeal to an eclectic audience (15 radio stations, ~240 songs).-Certain sequences in missions and wanted levels above three stars are scored with music, which is a subtle but neat addition.-Talk stations and commercials are still pretty funny, but not as good as GTA IV.Score: 8/10Comments: The radio stations in each GTA game contribute a minor but significant and lasting effect on the atmosphere of the game. They capture the ambiance of the time, and provide a huge chunk of the entertainment throughout the entire game. I feel that GTA V was a let-down in terms of the quality of the radio stations; I think that GTA IV had the best soundtracks of any game in the series, by far. I loved (and dearly miss) Electro-Choc; I think that the Techno/Electronica station in GTA V (Soulwax) is a poor substitute. The West Coast Classics is a pretty good station featuring a number of good hits, and the Country station (Rebel radio) was surprisingly good. I was a little disappointed with the rock music selection (all types), and the omission of a station with heavy metal and/or death metal is notable. Again, I understand this is HIGHLY subjective, but I just felt like there was a lot more 'fluff' songs in GTA V than any previous installment. The talk stations and commercials are alright, but leave a little to be desired. I remember laughing so hard at the talk stations in GTA IV that I occasionally crashed my car or even killed myself while listening to such classics as 'Just or Unjust,' 'Integrity 2.0,' and 'The Martin Serious Show.' While 'Chakra Attack' on GTA V is a great rip on self-proclaimed spiritual gurus and is genuinely funny, the other stations don't really hold up. The commercials are alright, but again not nearly as funny as they were on GTA IVCONCLUSION: I stand by my score of 8/10. GTA V is certainly worth playing, as it is a very good game with many redeeming qualities, but I was underwhelmed with many of the core aspects of the game.er Jack Thompson-types--always a plus.Score: N/AComments: I admit, I wrote in this subsection for the sole purpose of discussing the torture mission. It's really not that bad, and I'm not going to get on a soap-box about torture, but it seems that it was a mission injected for the sole purpose of trumpeting a message. Politics aside, the mission itself is actually not that fun, and not as entertaining as you might think a torture mission would be. I found myself rolling my eyes not in disgust at the torture sequences, but at the fact that the developers sacrificed mission/game quality to trumpet a political message, no matter how justified they think they might be in their position. I understand their use of hyperbole to make a point about torture, and people will interpret it how they will, but I don't think that GTA V is the right venue for this. I also think that the message would be lost amongst some players, as you are rewarded on the mission for using all of the torture equipment, which sends a conflicting message. The whole sequence seemed preachy, and even though many would agree with Rockstar's stance on torture, this does not justify dulling down the game and getting preachy about politics. Leave the politics for election season--when I buy a game, I want to play a game to escape from politics, among other things, not to hear more real-world political commentary. A little of this is fine, but there is a limit, and GTA V crossed that limit with its much-hyped torture mission.Conclusion: I stand by my score of 8/10. GTA V is certainly worth playing, as it is a very good game with many redeeming qualities, but I was underwhelmed with many of the core aspects of the game.",

        "body": "Like I said,  I ordered it with two day shipping and got it 3 weeks later,  with a refund,  but moving on.The game is fun but the lack of content is killing the game.  Rockaway has completely abandoned this game for the Next Gen and PC unfortunately,  leaving people that bought the game to cough up an additional $60 and a new console to be able to get the content.Single Player: There is a lot to do during single player,  more than online I might add, and is a very cool experience. However,  the story goes all over with no plot and is a real waste of time in my opinion.  The characters seemed dull and was mostly centered around Michael and his family,  which was unnecessary. The single player is mainly for open world that's about it.Multiplayer: To start out,  68% of the players online are children under the age of 14. They do NOT need to be playing this. Moving on to the real multiplayer,  the multiplayer is EXTREMLY  limited to what is open world and what is not.  All the things you could do in single player has been reduced to a grain of sand in multiplayer and its plain boring.  It is fun to play with friends,  but is a severe time consumer because you are trying to get cash by doing 15 minute missions to get pocket change.  It's very annoying and is a gimmic to make you buy a Shark Card.Overall: kind of a cool game but with lack of content it gets boring very quickly for many people. I have owned both copies of this game,  one on ps3 and one on 360 and have spent many hours on it only for it to collect dust. This is not worth $50-60 maybe $30 at most.One final note: with games getting more graphic and violent,  please I beg you parents, think before you buy this for your kid.  Wait until they turn 15 or 17 and buy it for them. The last thing people want is to here a 12 year old trash talk on xbox live and try to troll",

But it makes it up by having the most cars out of every game and having alot more car customizations.I highly recommend buying this game even more now because of online it isnt like gta 4 it is open world but that option is still there with now another option to be able to make your own deathmatches and races etc",

And GTA is now sitting snug next to the Call Of Duty and EA sports franchise. Refusing to implement new gaming dimensions. GTA V is simply an exercise of tweaking at its best.No matter how much you want to dress up this game with mini-games, side missions, random encounters, car mods, tattoo parlours, clothing stores or property ownership, the reality is that we have played these mission a thousand times before. The game in itself is a dated piece of gaming. The Graphics, the size, the numbers may have been tweaked. Sure, the physical realm of GTA has been enhanced... but the open level design hasn't changed since GTA III from a decade ago.GTA V as a stand alone game is breathtaking. But its not a stand alone game. Its in fact the 15th instalment of a decade old franchise and when you put things into context, GTA V is a complete failure.This game is scripted by way of checkpoints. No matter how much you like to think otherwise, the 15 million copies of GTA V sold worldwide will all be completed in the same exact way.Somewhere along the long line of GTA instalments, this game became a very linear experience. Rockstar continues to tinker and improve storyline and missions and this game just falls further and further under the constraints of predefined waypoints.What this game has needed for quite some time is a gaming overhaul, a new open world level design to go hand in hand with the open world environment. One that is undefined. Undetermined. One to interact with. Not one to complete.Rockstar spent so much resources on mapping the physical realm when in reality what GTA needs is mapping of a different kind.The interaction is dated, it is lagging and lagging heavily behind.Playing Yoga is pointless, having money is pointless, getting tattoos is pointless. These are pointless novelty interactions posing as open world game design. The world around you doesn't evolve, doesn't change, not significantly, not permanently. Not unless you proceed with a predetermined mission. This isn't real time. And your personal choices have no significant meaning.You can't be a policeman, you can't be a FBI agent catching criminals, a SWAT leader busting criminals, a vigilante killing criminals... a hitman, a warlord, a politician, a mafia boss, a gang leader, choose factions, break factions, double cross friends, make friends, make enemies, spy, defect, disband, destroy.... These real world options are never yours to make. This type of mapping is what Rockstar should have spent some of its world record breaking money on creating.Instead rejoice. Praise to all.... we have a GTA map that is bigger than all other GTA maps combined. Congratulations!",

I personally hate first-person shooters so if a game comes out that is a 3rd person i will try to pick it up. the whole series have been 3rd person and i've gotten every one and this is by far the best game Rockstar has ever made.  it's got something for everyone from the complex interweaving story line to the great graphics to the awesome gun battles.  it also stays with the series charismatic tongue-in-cheek humor and dark view of the world to create a darkly comic and extremely interactive environment.  their was a lot of pressure on Rockstar for this game and they fulfilled my expectations.  hopefully GTA online will be at least as good if not better",

In all honesty, would anyone pay an extra 10 dollars so they could go into the casino as DLC?  And would you then pay again, with real money, in order to have other activities opened to you?Do you remember playing GTA 3 and how cool it was to be able to take a break from missions and work out, bulk up, go out, get hot coffee, eat a meal, customize and KEEP your vehicle. It even had the hydraulics back then. In this version there are no cops driving around and this is supposed to be a crime ridden city based on realism. Some NPC calls the police on their cell in the middle of no where and cops show up almost immediately. WTF?I would give up half the map for more interactivity. Driving around is fun but too much for too long and it becomes filler for the game.The graphics are better but that alone does not justify all the emptiness in the game. All in all, alot of gloss, alot of promise but essentially empty. Kinda like junkfood.The only redemption comes from playing as Trevor.",

        "body": "I wasn't a fan of GTA IV.  It was a great game, but I felt trapped in the city and missed the open spaces of San Andreas.  Well, we are back to San Andreas now, with all the stuff we liked from GTA San Andreas on GTA IV level graphics.  The graphic jump per se isn't as large as it was between San Andreas and IV, what we get is a greater map, and a much larger variety of terrains and features.  There is some improvement to texture (i think) but not on the level of the previous 'jumps' of improvements of the series.The story rocks, and I liked the multiple characters idea.  Now larger missions have heist mechanics where you can choose ways of performing the mission which impact not only the basic approach of the mission but how it will unfold (a incompetent hired help can mess up things, while a capable one will want more money).The characters are great, but IMHO Trevor just steals the show. He probably has the most incredible introduction of any character in GTA history, specially if you played and liked The Lost and the Dammed DLC for GTA IV.The driving is really responsive once again. They listened to us so bicicles are back, you can dive the depths and fly the skies (the flying mechanics are pretty neat too).  The mini games changed (mostly) from more indoor to more outdoor.  So golf and tennis instead of bowling a pool, but you still have darts.I might be biased since San Andreas was my favorite GTA, but GTA V keeps up with the franchise.I should note the story is overall a bit more serious than San Andreas, but quite a bit less serious than the more dramatic parts of GTA IV.  For me it was just the right balance.",

        "title": "GTA V- An In-Depth Review",
        "body": "GTA V is such a massive game that it will take a while for me to be able to put into words everything that makes this game truly a fantastic video game and one with the best open world to date.To start off, the story and the world itself is primarily a satire on modern American society, which exaggerates and emphasizes issues sun as the use of extreme violence, the popularity of the media and technology, and the different types of lives to be lived. In Los Santos, you get to be three characters, which is an opportunity of gaming that I haven't really seen before, the idea to seamlessly transition to another character, doing something completely unscripted in the expansive world of Los Santos. First you have Michael, a rich criminal who decides to enter the business after he enters some rough waters; Franklin, an aspiring repo man who is trying to make it big in the world; and Trevor, the most insane character you could manage to play as in a game. I mean he is insane; pathologically, really.The story really feels like a crime saga and though it does a fine job in the beginning, with appropriate pacing of it's set pieces and it's characters, the main fault to this game is it's second act. Many hours into the game, you'll find yourself just a bit lost in the narrative, and in a negative way. Far too much is happening for you to really get invested in whats happening, and far too many villains are introduced for me to be able to register their weight and role in the story. I found myself for at least ten hours worth of story missions begrudgingly completing tasks required from me to partake in in order to progress the story, for that reason only. It's written fine, as is the rest of the script, but it's to convoluted and almost feels as if its trying to compete with the massive variety and scope of the open world in what you could do in it.Thankfully, the third act, which is really after the third to last heist-I think I should actually mention a part of the story rather than just gloss over it and point out it's flaws. The heist aspect of the story are these massive events that are really being led up to in anticipation, and rarely do these ever disappoint. These heists rake in tons of money from places that you are robbing, and is really the only part in the game where control is 100% given to you.Which leads into the second point of the story that I would like to make before we reroute back to what I was saying earlier. In most of the side missions, I persistently felt an unnerving sense of hand-holding, in which I was constantly being told what, how, and where to do something. It really took me out of it, and felt like a huge contradiction to the massive amount of freedom that you can get whilst roaming in the open world.Now, to return to what I was saying...Thankfully, the third act, which is really after the third to last heist, gets a tone that wasn't seen for the rest of the game. It feels a bit brooding, as if all is leading up to some grand and bombastic finale (which it does, mind you). Secrets and lies are revealed, shots are fired, and the third act makes up for most of the second acts muddled events by having a tighter script and better story progression.In the gameplay aspect of the game, there are really two things that you will be doing: shooting and driving. Shooting is smooth and responsive, and also generally easy, as GTA V's aim is always lock on (because if it's not then it's damn near impossible to use) and the guns you continue to unlock feel more powerful and rewarding. Cover is very good in the game, some of the best movement i've seen in a game. Gunfights work absolutely well in a gameplay aspect, and I only ever failed because I simply made the wrong tactical choices of movement.The other main gameplay aspect is the driving; I never played GTA IV, so I have no idea how it is comparatively, but I heard that V is much better. And it really is. Cars have real weight to them, and with practice, drifting can be a cool and advantageous move. Driving feels wonderful and it really is a joy to take a car (which you will most likely have stolen) and drive across the desert as the sun goes down. Gameplay wise GTA V does all that it sets out to do right.Now for the big one; the real reason why this game is one of the best games of all time: the open world.It is a huge cliche to say &#34;living, breathing world&#34; when talking about a video game's open world, but this is the first game where I feel that term really encapsulates what Los Santos really feels like. In most other games I play I feel that the world revolves around me, and while in some games it's fine, like in Infamous 2, sometimes it feels good to see a world evolving in it's own ways, not giving you all the attention. The citizens of Los Santos are living their own lives, driving to a specific destination, taking their dog out for a walk, talking on the phone (and to my surprise, I have never heard the same phone conversation twice, even including in GTA Online). Not only that, but the world is simply gorgeous, and one of the best-looking games on the system.Not only does the world feel alive and as if it has it's own personality, but there is also so much that you can do in it. The world map will give you things to find, such as certain missions that will even possibly unlock other branching missions; but, unlike many other games, I was actually rewarded with scouring the city and Blaine county, because that allowed me to find many of the other missions not shown to me, and many of the MANY random encounters that you can run into in the world. It's so seamless that it feels organic, like it just naturally appeared and somehow now an NPC has a new story to tell me. If you keep driving in San Andreas, chances are you will see someone calling out at you, doing something curious, or holding up a store (which amazingly you can either stop them from finishing the job or actually aid them in their escape). For the first time I would have to define a certain aspect of a game as perfect. GTA V is not my favorite game, nor is it a 10/10, but it's open world is one of the most incredible things I have ever seen with countless activities and races to participate, people to meet, and genuinely interesting tasks to complete. There is absolutely no flaw in the open world, as far as I could tell.GTA V is a masterpiece. It comes damn close to bring my favorite game, with incredible gameplay and a awe-inspiring open world to explore. It only fails in the second act of it's story, and it only fails because it tries too hard. And even then it's first and particularly it's third act is simply exquisite.This game is a marvel, and must be played. Be warned of the poor choice you are making if you choose to not.9.8/10ve real weight to them, and with practice, drifting can be a cool and advantageous move.

        "body": "Gta v is simply unreal. The map is huge, there's plenty to do and it's just a great time waster. Then there's the three characters, Michael, Trevor and Franklin. Each one is unique in their own way so play with the one you like best. Also I've noticed references to other games and movies within the game. That I found to be pretty cool. Gta v also features animals and I think Rockstar got this from red dead redemption. Also the desert scenery reminds me of rdr. The game also lets one customize cars to the way they want and that's a fun feature in it's own. I must mention this game is highly mature so ITS NOT FOR KIDS!!!! So please don't buy for or let children play this game. But it truly rocks. Glad I bought it!",

This game blows me away in every way imaginable.  The graphics are top notch.  The sound is top notch, the story is top notch.  Rockstar is just completely showing off now and I love it.I admit, I was a bit skeptical of the three character system, but I never should have doubted it.  Rockstar implemented it to perfection and it runs beautifully.  I am invested in each character completely.With tons of missions, side missions, to just driving around causing complete chaos, in my opinion, Grand Theft Auto 5 is as close to gaming perfection that we may ever see, that is until Grand Theft Auto 6 for next gen.If you are a gamer, you owe it to yourself to get this game, as it is one of, if not the best game of all time, hands down!!!!!",

There is so much to do in this game and different paths to take. I've beat the game not 100% but it was a lot of fun. The stock market layer is an awesome addition and there are tons of guides to that and many other things in this game.    I found myself skipping cut scenes once they got repetitive and annoying. I know its a mature audience game but the language seemed a bit unrealistic at times with all the overly done cursing.     The game was challenging enough not to be boring but not so difficult that I gave up(on default difficulty)    This game is so good I can't wait to see the next one. I know its over a year old but its still a great buy for Christmas or birthday.",

The First Person mode and upped graphics on the PS4 is enough for me to play the story again. Although had issues with multiplayer lobbies on the day of release, it is now 11/28 and I have zero issues with online (with the occasional time-out but that'll exist on every console)As for the bugs, I either haven't played enough (and believe me, I have), or no one can be happy with anything anymore, I haven't experienced anything major. The minor lag in frames per second here and there, but that came with just about any next gen console game on the current market. So far so good.Lastly, had no issues with installing my pre-order cash pack (500k GTA$ + 300k via PS Store), was funded to my characters' banks instantly (something Uplay+Ubisoft  should work on in their games)5 stars, no problems.",

Some say they can run the game &#34;maxed out&#34; with a 2gb card, but when you set the textures setting up to very high, that settign alone asks for more than 4gb of memory (4330 for me). I realize that not all reviews are biased, but I would recommend that if you are considering this game perhaps you look at the platform you are buying it for and understand that it may crash from the starting screen alone (if you get that far).Things may change, but it has been a couple of weeks and only 2 patches have been released that address any issues, including day-1 GPU driver upgrades that cause issues for some people while solving issues for others.

Actually the game looks pretty amazing sometimes!Issues:-NO PC version - ironically setting me up to get robbed later on I guess but just imagine how this game will look on PC/Next Gen!-The driving, fist fighting, and gun aiming are still oversensitive and a little wonky at times.-Not that big of a fan of the characters - geez how many movies/commercials have I seen the exact same cliche characters. Is it just me or is Michael too whiny!-You can die practically from the minimalist of situations such as tripping over a curb.-Character/Car customization is limited - something they really could borrow from SR4 even though I know they are NOT the same but just sayin.-Heist missions for the most part feel very contrived and forced.-And lastly just like GTA4, it takes itself way too serious most of the time while putting in supposed funny bits that would cater to a 13 year old's sense of humor-this doesn't make any sense.In total, of course the game is not bad and is actually quite a good game. I just have some personal issues with it that I felt like sharing because who knows maybe this would help you make a objective decision despite the diarrhea of positive reviews telling you how AWESOME this game is. Regardless of what you read or hear, do yourself a favor and get this game before the PS3 goes extinct. You won't regret it!",

The online portion is a blast, but the single-player storyline has some troubling aspects. Rockstar has gotten very good at telling the stories of fundamentally flawed and broken people through the last several iterations of GTA, and the delivery here is perfect. Unfortunately, the actual contents of the story are extremely unpleasant. None of the characters are actually like-able, and progressing through the story requires some quite abhorrent actions (and that's saying a lot for a game that features as primary gameplay mechanics stealing cars and murdering innocent people). That said, driving, flying, and shooting are all fun and easy to control (though a tiny bit different from GTA IV).TakeawayWorld: amazingGameplay: funOnline: sometimes buggy, but getting better and still funSingle player story: well-executed, but disturbing",

        "body": "I never thought I would ever say this about a GTA game, but GTA V gets boring fairly quickly after you've beaten the main story missions. There isn't really anything new in GTA V that hasn't already been done in prior editions. In fact, compared to GTA: San Andreas, GTA V is actually lacking in some areas. The graphics and environment are more realistic and aesthetically pleasing, but other aspects of the game hamper it's replayability, namely the ridiculously zealous police who have near super-human ability and spawn new police helicopters every 5 seconds. Other negative aspects include some of the game physics and vehicle handling. And once again, an almost total lack of building interiors severely limits the scope of the game. There's a casino and race track but they aren't available as properties and no casino games can be played, why not? Why are most of the hobbies and activities incredibly lame? Tennis, golf, and darts, that's it? Why not skate boarding, surfing, hang-gliding, etc?The main story missions are great for the most part, but it seems like Rockstar is really dropping the ball. GTA 4 and 5 still don't come close to matching the greatness of GTA: San Andreas.",

This game, however, has such a great combination of fantastic graphics, open &#34;worldness&#34; and a story that makes me want to see the conclusion. Even the online which was admittedly broken at first is still fun to play once in awhile. Can't wait to see what Rockstar can do in a few years on the new consoles.",
