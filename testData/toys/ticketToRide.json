There's some strategy, but it's not as cut-throat as Settlers of Catan or Risk, which makes for a more light-hearted social game.  There are multiple strategies you can use to win.

The game is easy to learn and is set up so that you never really know who has won until the end.  The different 'destinations' everyone is trying to reach really spreads the game out at the beginning, and allows for different strategies.  I like how different it is every time you play, and also that it doesn't take hours to finish.  It also is more of a thinking game than a aggressive game, and it has a nice pace to it.  We have found that a game lasts around 45 minutes.The only complaint I have is that it take a while to add up the points at the end, and it is very easy to make mistakes.  The game is structured so that longer tracks have a much larger reward, but it means adding up a lot of odd numbers.  There is a numbered area at the edge of the board to keep track as you go, but it is easy to forget a track, so you really need to add it all up after.",

Plus, the fact that my wife and 7 year old picked this up in no time made it that much more enjoyable.  Not only that, but everyone has a relatively fair chance at winning despite different skill levels, which is a testament perhaps to the luck of the tickets, but even that you have some control over.",

They become difficult to remember and basically you end up playing and winning or losing incorrectly. Not Ticket to Ride... it took about 5 - 10 minutes to fully understand the game and after a couple of moves you totally get the game. Super fun, easy to play and there are strategic / gambles that you make.... like how long do you gamble on a route? What routes are other people doing? Can you stop them or should you hold out for that one color train card!?!",

You may have to change the rules to make it easier. But if it is for a couple or to play with you group of friends, trust me and buy this one! Yeah it's a little cosly when compared to few other board games but I thinks it's worth it. It is so much fun!",

The five year old needs help playing, but the eight year old quickly grasped the concepts and began strategizing her play.  We adults loved it, also--a challenging game that lets the whole family participate.  A game can be completed in an hour to ninety minutes, and offers the opportunity to learn about geography and history while having fun.  The elements of the game (plastic railroad cars, playing cards, and scoring tokens) can be a bit overshelming, so it is important to stay  organized.",

When I'm playing the game it makes me feel like I'm actually building real-life train tracks ... this is probably aided by the introduction to the game where it tells about rich old friends meeting once each year and betting on who could get to a certain destination cheapest and fastest ... or something like that.

        "body": "Wonderful family game! I love this game well worth the buy, but can get expensive if you get addicted. You start buying the expansion which are not cheap.Thought this game itself stand alone is awesome in itself. The only cons were that the cards are small and not really managable and the quality of the cards are okay. The Ticket to Ride Europe is better quality and the cards are normal size. If you have issues with stress do not play the game it has you at the edge of your seat hoping for the right card and sweating to make the right decision. Great fun with the family!",

Turns go quickly and you can play a 2 person game in under 30 minutes.This game is easy to learn and explain, so it's ideal for adding a new player and for playing with older children.One thing I enjoy about this game is that there is very little dependence on &#34;luck&#34;.  You have the opportunity to make many decisions on each turn and these are what shape the game.  No dice!Strongly recommend for anyone looking for a game that is engaging but not too intense.",

Definitely more fun than a short 2 person game. We use the rules like there are 4 people and see who can have the longest continuous route. Great with a cold beer and a good classic movie.",

This Christmas, we received Ticket to Ride and although it wasn't released by our usual favorite, Rio Grande games, we gave it a try.  What a wonderful game!  It was refreshingly easy to learn how to play but the more times we play it, the more difficult the strategy becomes.  The strategy also changes depending on how many people are playing the game.  If you are a fan of Rio Grande games, you will love this one as well.  With so many fun board game options out there, does it really matter is there is a writer's strike going on? : )",

And since there are so many route cards, I've never played the 'same' game twice, although it is easy to pick out some of the more popular routes once you've played the game a number of times.You will need a decent sized tabletop to play this on--we tried on a 3x6 folding table and there just isn't enough room for all the cards, trains, and the board together if you have more than 3 people playing.My only complaint is that the scoring mechanism is pretty cumbersome. Most of the time when we play, we simply wait to score everything until the end which adds a nice element of surprise.Just be careful when you're playing and don't accidentally slam your fists on the table in celebration (ala Anne Wheaton on Tabletop)--the trains move easily!",
