I would suggest buying extra rockets if you have a wooded play area. Alot of our rockets ended up in the trees...eventually they come down, but extras are nice.This toy makes me smile when I play with it.",

From hand-held rocket wars starting at the Christmas tree, to distance competitions in the yard they are having a great time.    I bought the extra rockets to lessen the pick-up time between playing, and that was a good idea.  Also, read reviews before purchasing and added a zip-tie to stablize the base.    The youngest boys (twins) have just turned 4 and were actually the first to get theirs unboxed and flying, scoring several hits on their older brothers, and their Dad, before they had to retreat from return fire.    We're loving it!!",

I explained how it worked (Santa had one for her as well but she does not know this yet) and she said &#34;I must tell Santa that I really want one of these too, please mum can we go see him now so I can ask for one?&#34;So Santa will be bringing another one to our house at Christmas, and I can't wait.

This item has far exceeded my expectations. This is my favorite toy ever, and my son is in complete agreement.The idea is that you stomp on the stomp box to send one of four foam rockets flying through the air. It is so easy, addictive, and fun. The stomp box is soft so even my three year old can send rockets hurtling 50 feet or more into the air. The air rushes through a flexible tube that you put the foam rocket on and sends it way higher than you think you're going to send it. The whole set up is connected to a plastic stand of three pieces that you snap together. Only a single wing nut attachment (included)is needed to hold it all together.You can angle the tube to send the rocket straight up, horizontally, or on a variety of trajectories. The foam rockets are very durable. They are soft so I wouldn't let a dog or cat chew them, but they have been indestructible in my son's overeager hands and have lasted damage-free through thousands of launches.My son is still working on coordination and has tripped over the stand on multiple occasions so it does come apart rather easily, but it just snaps back together--no big deal. I'd like to see an improvement in future versions, but I don't see a reason to downgrade the rating for this small inconvenience.We played with it for around an hour and a half the first time that we used it. If you have a child this young, then you know the miracle of keeping a child entertained that long. It is an outdoor toy for sure, but I'm thinking we'll get use out of it in a hallway or children's playroom during stormy days. I hope you'll order one if you are on the fence about it. The whole family will love it.",

Well, the three-pronged stand that holds the end of the tube that fires the rocket is awkwardly designed and generally not used.  My kids typically hold the tube itself and point it at something while stomping.  They wish the tube was longer. The pieces come apart and get lost long before anything breaks.My younger one does like to chew on the rockets.  I can't fault the toy for that.Great fun.

        "body": "The ultra stomp rocket is lots of fun,rated for ages 8+ but even my 5 yr. old nephew (could get it 15-20 ft. up) loved it. You can easily set the rocket to launch at any angle you like,the older kids (10+)  like to aim it at each other and try to catch it , unless you were hit in the eye I don't see how you could get hurt. You will never get near the claimed 200ft. , a ten yr. old might get 80ft. (achieved only by JUMPING on the 8'X4.5' air filled launch pad) which is great and thrills most, a teen could get 100ft. and it's at that point where the problems start. The plastic tail fins can't withstand the force that the sudden acceleration required to achieve that hight puts upon them and they are ripped apart. If you're lucky you might get 3-4 blasts of 100 to a max of maybe 110ft. and once the fins are ruined they only go 30ft maximum. My only other issue which is minor is the 3 pieces that connect to form the T shaped frame that lays on the ground and supports the launch tube,this pops apart occasionally on hard launches. I solved this issue by using an  elastic band around the joint where the 3 pieces meet. All said, great fun for all ages but don't let the big kids JUMP on the launch pad,have them stomp with one foot,keep it under 100 ft. and you will be happy.",

Once the tubing is broken, the stomp rocket is essentially useless.For it's price, you get a fun product that has wonderful replay value. As long as the child can depress the stomp pump hard and fast enough, the rocket will blast off.",

Unfortunately, the rocket fins did not hold up well against eager little hands fighting for a turn. The kids tore a lot of them off. I think they can be reattached, preferably with stronger glue. The rocket bodies themselves were made of good foam. I don't think the kids could tear them. The base was easy to put together, but came apart pretty quickly if the kids accidentally kicked it too much. However, the base parts were not damaged by this, so I just reassembled it.",

I typed in 'boy's toys' into the Amazon search bar, and found this toy was in my price range. With about 20 gifts given at this 5 yr. old's outdoor BDay party, the Stomp Rocket was clearly the biggest hit (can be played w/ inside too). Although the party was a 'carnival' theme with booths, games, and concessions, most of the kids wanted to try this toy - the rockets really sore. One Mom came up to me, when she found out I gave it, and wants me to order one for her (she's not online). Kids from 2 to 7 were playing w/ it - I'd recommend this toy for this age group - after 7?  This gift was inexpensive enough that I also bought  the Stomp Rocket Refills.",

You'd think a bunch of 6 year old boys would have managed to break a plastic toy that they jump on, but so far it has managed to stand up to their rough use.The toy is very safe, too. The soft ends on the rockets mean that no one gets hurt should one accidentally fly into the crowd of kids. Apparently this toy is popular, too. The neighborhood kids in my own cul-de-sac own one as well. They're out in the court playing with the Ultra Stomp Rocket for hours at a time, nearly every day before school starts back up again.",

        "body": "All four of my children ranging in age from three years to 10 years and my husband love this product.  We used it outside with the stand and shot it high enough up in the sky that we lost sight of it until it came racing down.  Inside, we use it off the stand and aim it at a target or just across the room.  My youngest still has to stomp on it, but my older children can squeeze the launch pad under their arm to get it to go off.  Because it is the Jr. set and made entirely of foam, it doesn't hurt when it is launched directly at you.  I found this out, several times.  : )    The one downside of this toy is the stand.  We had to reassemble or readjust it after each launch.  It's quite flimsy.  However, if you're short enough, the stand isn't necessary when you stomp on the pad.  Just lay the pad down, hold the hose in your hand and stomp.      I'm not sure why this says it is a glow set, the rockets are white, but they don't glow.  Perhaps adding some glow stickers or paint would be fun.      If you shoot this outside, you will need a wide open space, the rockets are easily caught in trees.  Also, make sure there aren't any dogs around.  lol.  It only takes a second for them to destroy the rocket.    Overall, I am very pleased with this product and bought several more to use as birthday presents.",

It's such a simple concept yet completely entertaining and can also be used to teach basic principles of physics.  The age on the box is 8+ and I think older kids might be a bit bored with it.  I'm not sure why it is rated for such an old age because there are no small parts (except a screw assembly) and the rockets are very soft even when they land on heads - yes, my kids tested this.The little kids need very little strength to get it to work.  My 21-month-old was able to get it to go about a foot off the ground and was absolutely thrilled to be able to play with the bigger kids.  The heavier the kid, the higher the rocket goes which is an excellent way to start a conversation about science and get kids curious.  And, seeing the rocket launch and figuring out where it's going to go is an endless source of entertainment.All in all, the best money I have spent on a toy in a long time.",

I REALLY wish I'd bought two sets because that set came with TEN rockets for the same price as this one that only comes with 4. The base on this toy IS flimsy...ours broke after only a few uses but my husband went to Home Depot and got 4 curved PVC pieces, connected them to an X piece and drilled a hole in the middle then stuck the black launch tube through and VOILA - a super sturdy base that has lasted us 4 years and is still going strong through MANY uses by all 3 of our kids. The best time was when we had it at the park and a bunch of random kids just lined up to each have a turn. We had a dozen kids in line and finally OUR kids complained they weren't getting enough turns. Unfortunately our last rocket just cracked and broke yesterday to my 3 year old's dismay. I'm disappointed this one only comes with 4 rockets but it's better to get this rather than just 4 replacement rockets. We're getting a set of the 'high performance' stomp rockets too for the two older kids (8 and 6). Get this toy - you won't be disappointed!!",

        "body": "This is really a neat toy that many children can enjoy at different ages.  And, adults have fun watching the children have so much fun & once in awhile jump in to see if they can stomp a rocket too - LOL.     We've used it about 5 times over the last 2 weeks & it has held up well.  There was a 13 year old, a 10 year old & a 2 year old.  The older one's stomped on the rocket while the youngest loved watching the rockets launch into the sky.  They then would run & find the rockets & bring them back to the older children to do it again.  It was fun for all of them & nice that it was something they could do together.    The age range is for older kids, but little one's can join in too w/ help & supervision.  However, I do want to point out that supervision for the younger one's is very important.  The foam of the rockets is basically styrofoam & if bitten off could be very unsafe.  Don't let little one's around this by themselves.  Safety is top priority.    Overall rating is lots of fun for children (and adults - smile) of all ages, but if smaller children are around adult supervision is needed so they don't get the rocket in their mouths.    This comes w/ 4 rockets, but if you have a lot of trees I suggest ordering some extras.  What goes up doesn't always come down if you have a lot of trees for them to get stuck in.    OH!  The fact that they glow is super cool!  They do indeed glow & if you have them inside at night they are lit up.  Just wanted to point out they do glow & very well.",

The packaging doesn't seem very exciting - even the instruction sheet included makes the toy seem kind of cheap.  Set up takes about 3 minutes - very easy.  We walked this over to the park since we weren't sure if the rockets would land on the roofs or get caught in the trees around our house.  Once we had it going, everyone kept trying to get another turn.  Even my 3 year old was able to send the rocket flying and he hardly weights anything!  We now keep it in the bottom of our stroller for when we go for walks.  We like to take it out and play with it for a few minutes when we come to a park or field.  So far the rockets have held up well.  We have only used rocket so far and I think it will last for a few more months.",

        "body": "After reading the reviews, I bought both the Stomp and Ultra Rockets to compare them.In each case, as others have stated, they go about half the advertised heights. About 50 feet and 100 ft actual height, respectively.I also found the launch pad to be flimsy, but it works. I ended up laying logs on each leg of the launch pad to keep it steady.Besides the rocket shapes and materials, the only difference in the two sets is that the launch tube for the Ultra Stomp is a couple of inches longer than the Stomp tube. That's why the Ultra goes higher. The Ultra Stomp launch tube is black so you can tell it from the Stomp launch tube which is blue. You really need the weight of an adult to get it to go the maximum height. My 2 1/2 year old, 38 pound grandson could not get a rocket from either set to launch with one foot. It was still fun using these sets and will suffice until  the kids are a little older and can use the Estes model rockets with real rocket engines that go 1000 feet.",

He was thrilled with how high he could launch this rocket by simply stomping on the air peddle.  He had all the adults running around trying to catch the rockets that were flying too far away.  Definitely need a big open area with no trees, otherwise the rockets will get stuck in the branches (yes, the rockets go that high).The only downside is that it's all made of plastic so the rocket launcher is a little flimsy.  We solved that by having someone hold the launcher in place while my nephew stomped on the pedal.  The person holding down the launcher is also able to aim the rockets in any direction.  So that was another fun game aiming the rockets to hit targets.This turned out to be a great toy for my nephew and all the campers (adults and kids)!",

The biggest downfall is that the fins fall off the rockets easily so I'm not sure how long it will last. We also had to tape the stand together because it kept falling apart.",

        "body": "My two boys, ages 7 & 4, absolutely love playing with this toy!!  The only thing I wasn't crazy about and would recommend if you do purchase this is to buy extra rockets because after some use the rockets can crack and then they don't blast off because of splits in the plastic.  Also the tripod that the rocket launcher is made of doesn't want to stay together so I found myself constantly putting it back together for my boys.  Maybe if it we hot-glued it that problem would be fixed.",

As adults, we were able to shoot the rockets really high (couple landed on the roof).  Since they are made of styrofoam, we could even launch the rockets in the house without any damage.",
