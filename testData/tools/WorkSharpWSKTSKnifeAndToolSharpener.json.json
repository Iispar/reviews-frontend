It has  been on my want list for over 2yrs, but this year my wife took care of that and this morning  got me it for Christmas. I'm in awe of how freaking well this works and pissed I didn't do it sooner. Being able to put an edge on manually in the field is a great skill to have. One that I have learned over many years but, to my fellow woodsman, hunter's, and bushcrafter's there is no way even if you're Ray Mears could you throw a literally shaving sharp edge on a butter knife in a few minutes.. yes I did it just like the YouTube video it's no joke. A good video for proper  use is the one done by Boker knives it's in German but it shows the right placement and draw speed. Truly a great investment for your workshop/mancave.. seriously so easy even a woman could do it.... the only con right now is there is no guide for the scandi grinds like many of us have on our mora knives but I'll figure it out.. I already figured out how to do my TBT-1 and that's saying something.",

        "body": "Most good, one bad. This little machine is a very effective means of sharpening a blade, quickly and will put a very good convex edge on a knife. It is easier than other sharpening systems as the guide gives you the correct angle, and you don't have to maintain it by eye and feel. It comes with two guides, a 50 (25/25) for outdoor knvies and a 40 (20/20) for kitchen knives. The difference besides the angle is that the guide slot itself is narrower for kitchen knives. An optional guide of 40(20/20) for larger outdoor knives is also offered. In concept more acute angles could be offered by additional guides but I guess that would infringe on the market for the Deluxe version (Ken Onion) of this sharpener.This sharpener, using the 3 grit belts, especially at 20 degrees will produce a very very sharp edge, If you are inclinedto strop it with compound afterwards it will be even sharper. The one drawback, is that it is VERY easy to round off the tipof your knife. This is a risk that goes with any kind of power grinder, not just this machine. But I dropped a star because there is no caution or information on the box or instructional DVD about this. In fact, if you continue to sharpen knives exactly as in the DVD, you will eventually run into the tip problem. Users have determined that lefting the tip off when halfway across the belt resolves this problem. But it would be nice if the manufacturer examined and addressed this issue.Since I bought this unit I have sharpened 8 knives. And ruined the tip on one.",

I was very impressed the results, my knives are now quite sharp and the sharpener did not leave visible marks or scarring on the blades. During operation the machine was easy too hold, not very noisy and I did not create any sparks or flying shards of metal.",

It also works great for initial sharpening as well.  I normally carry several knives in my pack in case one becomes dull...this year I used one hunting knive to process three deer.....and I could have usd it again if neded.  It also works great on touching up kitchen knives.  The ability to use it on straight and serrated blades makes it a one stop tool.  I highly recommend the Work Sharp WSKTS knife and Tool Sharpener.....it will be the last knife and tool sharpening tool you buy.",

With this product, it takes a minute so sharpen and another minute to polish an 8' knife, which helps it 'glide' through the material being cut.  I've sharpen roughly 30 knives, big and small, and still on the same set of belts.  The medium grit belt is wearing out, because I used it the most.  I'd venture to say that it'll last another 10-20 more.  Overall, it's a very well-designed piece.  BTW, to make the belts last longer, try to avoid long 'sessions' which tend to heat up the backing and bonding material which would cause premature failure.",

Come time to take the belt of is no problem, takes 4 seconds. Very Easy.  It just feels natural to sharpen the knife with this product. I sharpened the wife's kitchen knives, sissors and my super small pocket knife. They are really sharp.  With an electric stone sharpener, you can't see the stone against the knife whereas you can see the belt flex againt the blade of the knife with this product.  I don't know how long the belts last.

The belts are extremely easy to replace, the guides slip on easily and the results are exactly as advertised. In no time every knife in my kitchen were razor sharp. Unfortunately in March it quit working. Using past experiences as my guide I drug my feet before going down the warranty replacement road. This is the true test of a company's  metal. I went online to review the warranty process. I notice a &#34;Chat&#34; button so I thought what the heck, I'll give it a try. I was immediately greeted with a pleasant, grammatically correct (not that I am an English professor by any stretch of the imagination) response with correctly spelled words. I told her my problem and she quickly got me set up. In less than 2 weeks I had a new unit. Quick, painless and friendly. When I told her how impressed I was with the customer service she responded &#34;Thank you. We are a small family owned company and we believe you should have a good quality item that lasts. I'm sorry you had a defect. We will get you back up and sharpening in no time.&#34; Despite best efforts things break. I understand that. It is how a company responds to these events that define them. I have this and a Work Sharp WS3000. I highly recommend both items and now that I know the integrity of the company I will look forward to my next purchase from them.",

I had tried all kinds of other sharpeners, but never really had good results...( because I'm really impatient and a half-ass ) The Work Sharp sharpens everything super quickly, even if you're not very good at sharpening things. ONE thing to be careful about though...the tips of all my knives have become pseudo-tanto points..( I should not have cut up the instructions...)

This will be a awesome christmas present!The video made perfect sense. So make sure you watch it. Just use the attachment that is correct for kitchen knife vs. outdoor knife and you are set! I sharpened the entire house set in minutes. An entire set as fast as it takes to do one knife the old way! Extremely worth the investment!",

The sharpener creates a convex edge on what your sharpening, now for tools like lawn mower blades, axes and other tools like this that's fine but for my knives I didn't like that, it did sharpen them - quickly - and better than most sharpeners i've bought  you know the quick and inexpensive ones  and while i'll say that it did sharpen them , and again I love the idea with the angle guides, I really love that idea , however it didn't get them quite as sharp as I expected.  and that is where my disappointment comes from, conceptually I love the idea.  If I were ever able to make an improvement I'd add something behind the belt to make the convex angle subdued, the rounding on my knives was too much  too rounded. but for tools it's like axes  which have a rounded edge  it's great.  Another problem that I had is with serrated blades the idea is to flatten the back side , instead it rounded it.  I wish I had bought it from the company instead of amazon because they have a 30 day return policy with amazon you can return it only if the item is unopened.  if you opened it that's too bad.  CONCLUSION  I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR HUNTING KNIVES , nor  FOR THE FLAT BACKS OF SCISSORS.",

        "body": "This thing is great. It is easy to use and works as advertised. I have sharpened everything from my kitchen knives to my hatchets and machetes and I haven't been disappointed yet. I still like to sharpen my pocket knife with a stone because I like to but not because this sharpener doesn't work. When I registered the product, the company even sent me a free set of belts. Speaking of the belts, I'm still using my original belts and they are still doing their job. I hesitated before trying this sharpener because I've found most systems are not as versatile as they claim. This one is and doesn't require a lot of set-up or skill to get good results on a variety of blades, I even sharpened my shovel blades. Great item and company appears to be very customer oriented.",

        "title": "OMG!!! Outstanding!! Most Magnificent Sharpening Tool Ever!!",
        "body": "Hello,    I bought this incredible WKTS sharpening machine over a month ago.  Then I bought the heavy duty carry bag for it right after, off of the WKTS maker website.  But I got a bit busy and hadn't even unboxed the sharpener yet until this morning.  Plus I had been trying to use hand stones, the diamond sharpening stones. Hours and hours of using those stones and still could never get my knives exactly to where I wanted them to be as far as sharp.  I have the heavy duty handmade and Cold Steel/ SOG type bowie and survival knives and already tried several electric sharpeners unsuccessfully. they were either too week to sharpen my heavy blades or my blades would not fit in the slots. So I have to say that I was a bit skeptical about using this machine, but I did buy it out of curiosity and out of strictly reading all the positive reviews.  But I was still sortof afraid to try it for fear of ruining my knives.  Finally last night after just being totally fed up with using the sharpening stones for hours and hours and getting basically Nowhere with them, I broke down unboxed the WKTS tool.  I read the instructions which were so very simple and easy.  I had also been worried that the instructions were all real detailed and everything, what with the tool looking like a real sophisticated tool. But the instructions on it were the easiest and simplest instructions I have ever read. I got the WKTS and the attachment for Outdoor Knives, attached it and plugged the tool in. Wow!! In an instant it had a professional high quality razor sharp edge on my Cold Steel Trail Master bowie knife.  The WKTS had the edge on that knife hair-shaving razor sharp within just a few strokes.  Then I got out my Outback Bowie knife. Bang!! in minutes the WKTS had that heavy blade's edge hair-shaving sharp. Then I went to my handmade survivl bowie knife and got that blade razor sharp. Then onto the other knives I have and have been mainly using, all handmade high quality knives. I have quite afe wmore knives to sharpen, but I mean to tell you that in just minutes the WKTS had 6 or 7 of my most favorite knives hair-shaving razor sharp!  I could really kick myself in the arse for not using my WKTS tool before now.  I would have really saved myself a lot of time and effort and a whole lot of hand and arm pulling use! The WKTS is the absolute best knife sharpening tool I have ever seen and now used! Instead of it being a boring chore, it was actually the most fun using it.  It was just a ton of fun to use.  Folks are not lying when they say that the WKTS tool turns boring dreadful knife sharpening, which could take hours to do, into a fun-packed and exciting thing. Plus, I don't know about other people, but it made me feel kind of 'Tall-type' proud that my knives are now razor sharo!  I highly recommend this WKTS tool to anyone and everyone who has, uses, and loves for their knives, blades, and scissors to be sharp. Using this tool sure leaves a lot of time to do other things! If you have been looking for a simple and easy way to sharpen all your knives and blades and scissors and other objects requiring sharpening, then look no further because the WKTS tool is just what you need. ! Thanks for reading!",

Since this was a repair job, it took rather more passes through the guides than the instructions call for, but the result was an edge capable of easily shaving hair off my arm. More than sharp enough for the work I do with my outdoor knives, and very nice for finer work, as well.    The reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that the design isn't optimal for all styles of blade. My Ultima is a modified tanto-style, and the angle between the point section and the main blade ended up somewhat rounded. The guide also will give some difficulty  working with the very point on a tanto, so you're better off free-handing if you need the tip to be really sharp.    All in all, I'm quite pleased with the ease of use, and the results are admirable for the relatively low cost.",

I got one complete pass before the front pulley locked up.  I took the belt off and the plastic pulley was completely frozen.  There was no way to move it or to disassemble the cassette.I have a belt sander and have used many different models.  I know how to center a belt.  This belt was centered and was moving freely before it all locked up.  I am sending it back for a refund.All my knives are still in need of a good sharpening so if anyone has a recommendation I would appreciate hearing it.",

I only say that cause I know a couple of people that can do it by hand but I would race anyone of them with the Work Sharp and do it in half the time. It's afordable, affective, and quallity built. The best part is replacement belts are cheap too. I was looking for a tool to recut the bevel on some blades that had been vary abused. I talked to a guy that was demoing this tool to the store personel cause they were going to start selling the Work Sharp. I told him if he could fix one of those blades I had I would be sold not only did he fix it but he did it in about 2 minutes flat. It's all history from then on. I went home and that night got online surched it out and have not had an issue with it.",

With a machine shop background, I was familiar with small '3 wheel belt sanders' - we used to sharpen shop tools with them 40 years ago!  Work sharp has essentially crossed a mini - belt sander with a mini electric chainsaw power head and 'Walla' - the Work Sharp Knife and Tool Sharpener!!! Well built, and with angle guides to make sharpening a snap, it is a great little tool.  One big advantage of this sharpener (over stones, wheels and other 'hard' sharpeners) is that the belt will FLEX.  That allows for contouring to a blade, and also prevents grinding off excessive metal. With three grades of abrasive belts, there is wide versatility for sharpening, grinding and honing.  The belts seem to be holding up very well, and can be swapped out in just a few seconds. Also of interest to me is that the 'belt head' can be rotated to several positions - allowing for standard sharpening, compact storage, and also use as a mini finishing / deburring tool!  Quite ingenious.",

        "body": "This thing is f#%kin AWESOME!  I've always been a knife enthusiast, and own many high end knives.  Besides sharpening by hand, I've tried several sharpening systems, and while some of them work very well, this is by far the best I've ever used!  It takes only a minute or two per knife,  and the belts are really easy to change quickly.  It's actually so easy, it's enjoyable!  After I sharpened the folder and fixed blade knives that I carry daily to literally shaving sharp (seriously, i actually shaved with them!) I went nuts and sharpened the f#%k out of every knife in my house!  My girlfriend has cuts all over her hands from doing dishes because she's not used to them being that ridiculously sharp.  Then I snuck into my friend's house while he was at work and I sharpened all his knives.  Now he's got cuts all over his hands too!  He nearly amputated his thumb trying to peel an apple!  That's how f%^king sharp this thing will make your knives!!I'd definitely recommend this to a friend.  I guess maybe I should warn them first though.  ;-)",

But this sharpener puts them all to shame and will get your blades scary sharp...enough so that you can shave with them.  The build quality of the machine itself is very good and, although it is fairly light, I know it will last for a very long time.  Although some day I will have to replace some of the sharpening belts, they have worked for me for over a year without need to buy new ones.  It does a good job on scissors too.",

Now, the customer service is what I was impressed by, go online and register your machine and the company actually sends you one more of each belt absolutely free!! If you want sharp knives/tools and don't have the insane skills required to do it by hand then this will be absolutely perfect for you as it was for me.",

        "body": "I don't often write product reviews, but when they really hit a nerve with me, I gotta say something whether good or bad. And in this case, I finally found my knife sharpening nirvana. To back up for a moment, let me first say, I've been a seeker on the path of the fine edge since, well let's call it more than two decades now.   Dunno what it is, or why, but I've always valued a beautifully sharp knife. I bought Juranitch's Razor Edge book, I bought steels, and all kinds of manual sharpening tools. Achieving that beautiful sharpness, however, has been a somewhat elusive endeavor. Yeah, that's right until now! Don't get me wrong, I've done alright maintaining sharp knives, but grinding away on my Spyderco Triangle Sharpmaker, for example, just got to be too much work. And for really dull knives, I finally broke down and bought the diamond rods hoping to speed up the process a bit. Forget it! I'm selling that system now, b/c I'll NEVER go back to scraping steel over ceramic. This belt sanding method is just sooooooo much quicker, easier, and I'm getting edges now that are way nicer than I've ever been able to achieve with my ceramics.  One caveat, it is a belt sander and so it's easy to round off the tip or change the lines if you're not careful... practice on some not so precious knives first! But once you get the hang of it, it's no longer a chore to get shaving sharp knives and tools. Yeah, my shovels, clippers, axes, chisels, everything's sharp now! One thing I'll add is that I also really like using a Surgi Sharp leather belt on my Delta belt sander. The combination of the two makes knife sharpening a joy instead of a job.",

I sharpened all our kitchen knives and within 24 hours all three of us in the family had gotten cut in one way or another.  Word of caution, you have to get used to working with sharp knives.  I had a small very cheap Chinese folder that I carry.  I was able to get this shaving sharp.  It has been used on a daily basis around the house and Garage.  It has held is edge quite well even being very cheap metal.  I really love the convex edge this puts on your knives.

Now the little woman is so happy I'll be eating like a King for the forseeable future. Do yourselves a favor fellas, if your wife likes her knives sharp, you can't go wrong with the Worksharp. The only minor drawback is the tool gets hot pretty quickly, so take frequent breaks to allow it to cool. Also don't press down on the blade, you don't need to, just guide it smoothly through and the Machine will do all the work. And be careful you don't cut yourself on your now razor sharp cutlery. This thing makes your knives 'Martin Yan sharp' Also great for hunters and gardeners as you can sharpen pretty much anything with this tool.",

(over 25 years ago, I found it my back yaerd of a house I lived in before I moved here) I had that knife in my tool box used it for a screw driver, wire cutter you name. any way I took my Work sharp WSKTS Knife and tool sharpener and sharpened it. It now can slice paper. I would say I got my money's worth on this product. Very well made. I would recommend it. Of course nothing beats a good honing stone......this  Knife and Tool Sharpener really comes close. What would take a couple of hours with a Good Honing Stoen can be done with this tool in a few minutes.",

My only complaint (and it might be my own fault) is the bevels on all my knives are steeper on one side.

In one evening, between commercials, you too can sharpen all the kitchen knives on the rack.  The only down size is that it doesn't come in some sort of case or heavy bag for storage purposes.",

        "body": "First off let me say that I usually sharpen using stones freehand, however when it comes to sharpening you work knife that you know is going to get chipped, dulled, and destroyed, freehand sharpening seems to take far too long and far too often!  Sooo...I got this beauty and it literally took 5 mins to open the box, whip out a dull knife, and sharpen it to a keen edge using this machine!  It's not a perfect precision sharpening solution, and I would not recommend  it for use on any expensive knives, but for edc's and kitchen knives it can't be beat for speed and ease of use.  Pluses:  - It's fast!  - Get's a nice edge, not scary sharp, not 11 degree mirror polished bevel that can perform samurai sharpness tests, but a still polished edge that can shave hair and will handle all your everyday practical cutting needs.  - Simple to use.  In fact don't even bother to look at the instructions, I've heard they suck anyway.  Just open the box(the starting belt's already on the thing), slide the guide on, turn it on, and quickly(about 1 sec) draw your knife through keeping the knife against the guide.  Alternate this motion on both sides until it's sharp(5-7 passes on both sides),then repeat with the fine belt(which is super easy to change). That's it, you're done, it took a whole 5-8 mins, now you have time to sharpen that kitchen knife, maybe sharpen your friends knives, or maybe even raise your arms out and bask in your own super-egocentric glory from your recent acheivment, it's really up to you.  -Stropping after using this is the shnaaz!(that's obviously what the cool kids say)  -Not as loud as you would think.  It sounds about as loud as a cordless drill.  -It says that it's made in the USA.(If that matters to you)  Minuses:  - Not for high end knives since you could round the tip if you are not careful, and let's face it, if you have an expensive knife you are not going to want a 20-25 degree edge, you're going to want to sharpen and strop it at a very acute angle until you can pretend that you're a surgeon and you're knife is an elaborate scalpel.  - Green coarse belt is basically a bench grinder and will heat the blade up to fast to avoid ruining the temper to actually use.  However the red belt cuts more than fast enough and temper destruction should not be a problem unless you are going very slow.  - Gets hot quick, but again it only takes a short time to sharpen your knives so this shouldn't be a problem unless you are sharpening 6 or more knives in a row.

        "body": "So.... Just like a lot of you out there, I too watched a few videos and read a lot of reviews before purchasing this product.  With that in mind, I felt like I had a good grasp on how to properly use the tool.  When I received it from SharpenerSupplies.com, I was very impressed.  I immediately took my cheapest knife and put an edge on it that not even my most expensive knives have.  Did the paper test...Check.  Did the arm hair test....Check.  Now... on to the facial hair.  Sure enough I can shave with my pocket knife.  (For those of you saying you can't get your blade facial hair razor sharp,  that's your fault, and not the tools fault. I was able to accomplish this with several of my knives. My kitchen knives now will shave a the fuzz off of a peach.  I have noticed the fine/honing belt has a short life span. However, once it is no longer abrasive, you can take a metal polish and apply to it making it somewhat of a 7000 - 8000 grit.  Which will make your knives like a scalpel. I highly suggest keeping the old worn out belt and doing this if you truly want that Scary Sharp edge that shines like chrome.  There is a learning curve with this tool, and if you aren't careful, you will round the tip of the blade off.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS to avoid this.  That's why they were written and included in the box.  Be sure to practice first with a cheap knife you do not care too much for.  That way you can get the feel for how much pressure, when to stop, and how fast to pull through.  Within 10 minutes, you should have the hang of it and be able to get that razor edge you desire with no trouble.  Overall I would highly recommend this product to any knife enthusiast, hunter, or outdoors-man.  Great product.  Great customer service.  Well worth the small investment.",

        "body": "Let me start by saying I have tried almost every knife sharpening tool there is, and I always get the same result, a knife that resembles more of a butter knife than an actual outdoor/everyday use tool. I sharpened both my kershaw Cryo knife, along with a homemade hunting knife, with good to great results. The tool is easy to use, but do yourself a favor and read the directions first!! It easily in around 5-10 minutes a blade got both knives to paper cutting/hair shaving sharp. The only downside, hence the four stars, is that it cannot sharped all the way down the blade of my Kershaw because the blade stops are in the way of the blade guard, not a huge deal to me, especially since I modded the blade so that my finger can extend past the flipper, so I never sharpened that part of the blade anyways. Now onto the the method in which the tool sharpens the blades, most will complain that it ruins the temper, I would argue that they are very wrong. To get the blade up to the temper that would ruin the temper you wouldn't be able to even touch the knife, so that is my simple solution, after every pass place the blade on the back of your hand, if it isn't hot to you, then the temper will surely be fine. I will continue to use the knife sharpener and love it every time.",

        "body": "I ordered this bad boy on Sept 18 and it arrived early this morning (Amazon Prime is awesome!) As soon as I had a break from work, I took it out of the box and looked around for something to sharpen. What I found really put the Work Sharp to the test. I opened my desk drawer and remembered I had a cheap pair of 'Humvee' bowie knives that I use as practice throwers. They have been put through the ringer and since they were used for throwing knives, the blade sharpness was never that important. I pulled out the smaller of the two and felt over the blade. It was rounded and so dull it would have had difficulty slicing room temperature butter. I'm not kidding! (Ok, maybe a slight exaggeration, but not by much.)Setup was pretty straight forward and within a couple minutes I was ready to get to sharpening.Using their 20 degree guide and the green belt (the most course) I made six or eight swipes per side. Then I moved to the red belt (less course) and did six more. Finally, I switched to the lavender belt and went with four more swipes each side. Within two minutes, the blade went from duller than a 2x4 to shaving the hair off my arm with no drag what so ever.I can't wait to get home and sharpen all (yes ALL) of my knives!!",

        "body": "Before owning this, I had a Spyderco Sharpmaker which was ok but wasn't great.  There was still that human element of trying to swipe the blade straight downward which wasn't always easy for me.  Also, it took a while to reprofile some blade with different angle grinds.  I even messed up a couple blades with it due to my human error.I got this after the Sharpmaker was lost and I'm glad I went with this.  Wasn't quite sure about the convex edge at first but it cuts quite well.  Not amazingly razor edge sharp like you can get with a Wicked Edge which costs $350-500 depending on the kit purchased but I wasn't about to spend that much money so I went with this.  It performs pretty dam good for the money paid for it and of course since its basically a mini belt sander its the fastest knife sharpener I have.  I sharpened and reprofiled just about all my folding knives and kitchen knives in record time.I also like the versatility to use it on large tools like axes and shovels.I'm not a guy with a ton of patience so the fact that this machine is quick and impressively sharp for its price is quite the win for me.Previous sharpeners no longer used:-  Spyderco Sharpmaker = B-  Edge Pro (Apex?), Chinese knockoff = B  (original may be better with their stones but the concentration needed to press and hold the blade down with one hand without ruining edge was irritating)-  Lansky sharpener (4-5 different colored stones...similar to Edgepro Apex) = C  (I just didn't like this tool.  Even the Chinese knockoff of the Edge Pro felt and performed better than this.  Of course, I didn't want to get good at it since I disliked it from the beginning.)",
