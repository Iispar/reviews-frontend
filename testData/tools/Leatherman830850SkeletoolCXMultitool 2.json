Reason for 4 star is that my fear about the driver bit storage was realized the first day i carried it. I dropped it on cement. Bummed about the little scratch it took. To bummed I guess to notice that the bit stored in the handle had popped out. What really stinks is I can't just buy a single replacement. So my clumsiness is going to cost me 25 bucks. Yeah, half the price of the tool for a single lost bit.",

We used it when we moved houses for odd jobs here and there. The finishing for the screw driver got scratched with use but this is expected with tools. The material itself is light but strong, and the knife is sharp. I will recommend it to the general population but maybe not for people with arthritis or joints pain. Also be careful using the screw driver which can be tricky.",

        "body": "Recieved this as a gift from the other half. What a great tool. Lighter than I expected, and feels very solid. The blade is still very sharp(ive had it for about 6months), and it really is a high quality looking tool. The steel of the blade looks awesome, and performs flawlessly. It has a needle point, and is at the perfect curvature for cutting almost anything, no serrates are required. The flat tip and phillips head work great, not as great as a standard phillips head screwdriver, but its a lot easier than having to go get one, and works almost as well. They are not magnetic, wish they were tbh, but I love how they are stored, rather than just having 1 phillips and 1 flat head, you have 2 of each,or atleast 2 sizes.The pliers feel solid, and somewhat click/lock into place firmly. I wish the steel of the pliers was made of the same steel as the blade, because I can see a few wear spots when gripping steel occasionally. But it still looks good, and performs well. I carry this knife every day, it fits in the pocket nicely, but I tend to keep it on the far side of my pocket, because if you reach too hard in your pocket with that thing over to the left some, you can end up with a painfull scratch from the back corner of the blade.The carabiner/bottle opener works perfectly, havent had a bottle it cant open yet, and the little clip actually holds onto the bottle cap most of the time, so it doesnt fly off somewhere, truely awesome. It also doesnt show signs of use, or wear, its designed perfectly, really couldnt think of a better way to design it.Ive never had a leatherman, but usually prefer a gerber, however this one has sold me quite well. If all leathermans are designed as such, I will consider them twice. Gerber seems to make more full featured knives, and I wasnt looking for one, just an EDC, and this won the fight.",

However, all the tools work fine and the carbon fiber is a nice touch because it acts as a cushion for your palm when using the pliers.  I would recomend this tool to anyone!",

I previously tried a Gerber crucial fast which arrived broken, and 2 SOG B66 power assist that neither straight blade worked properly on.  The crucial just felt cheap in comparison anyway but it was considerably less money.  The Sog was in a different category but it felt very solid in hand and the pliers were definitely much stronger than the Leatherman.  Unfortunately the SOG's had awful quality control in my opinion.  I've tried SOG Flash so I know there knives with assist open do work properly.    Anyway back to the Leatherman. It has a nice feel in hand with a solid blade compared to the others.  I'm personally glad the newer CX models have a straight edge blade instead of the partially serrated as I feel it's more useful day to day.  I can't attest to longevity but after initial impressions I would recommend this to everyone, and have read nothing but good things about Leatherman's 25 year warranty.",

For after the job is done, throw in the Bottle Open which doubles as a Carabiner (fancy word for belt clip) and this is truly a great multitool.

The lower quality 420HC steel blade is serrated though on the non CX model.I thought this was a drawback till I realized that: 1. I really don't use serrated blades that much. 2. They are also harder to sharpen perfectly. 3. The harder/sharper 154CM steel makes a serrated edge less relevant.I love the tool and the grip on the pliers is very comfortable and lightweight.  I really enjoy the locking system for the bit piece, quite ingenious. Though proprietary bit pieces of course.I gave it one less star as the spare bit holder is a little loose of a design, and might have to crimp it in there more to ensure it doesn't fall out during heavy usage.

If you work in construction or something where you will use this constantly it will probably be a little small, but for everyday light use it is ideal. I have bought this tool twice, the first one went for a swim on a fishing trip and if lose this one I will buy a third one. Its that good.",

The carabiner clip is great for my belt loop and the clip works great in my pocket. This tool was great for me, I just needed something to open packages quickly and easily the basic bits they included work great and I'll probably soon be picking up the expanded bit set. The pliers work great and were the other main reason for my purchase. Besides that the wire cutter and stripper are a bit small for some of the wiring I work with but for household use or a pinch I think it would do great. Also the black is quite stylish, and yes I have gotten compliments on my multitool. No need for a holster with this bad boy, show him off! Only Con is the bottle opener is a bit cumbersome as it's built in with the carabiner. Still Love this tool though!",

        "body": "If you are thinking of buying the Skeletool or Skeletook CX, then you probably aren't looking for a multitool that has every possible gadget. It has a knife, a bit driver, a good set of pliers, a pocket clip, and a small carabiner clip that doubles as a bottle opener. That is all. It does not have scissors, a file or a saw. It does not come with a sheath. It comes with two double-ended driver bits - one with two sizes of phillips head and one with two sizes of flat head. These are proprietary bits so you cannot use any other bits from other tools you may already own. I strongly recommend ordering the Leatherman bit set right off the bat. It's mainly intended for backpackers who don't really need basic tools to repair and maintain gear in the field while keeping weight to a minimum.  It's about the same size and weight as my Benchmade Stryker folding pocket knife and I find it comfortable to carry in my pocket or clipper to my pack or belt loop (though that's a good way to rip a belt loop and lose the tool).     The big debate is whether the CX model is worth the extra money or whether you should just buy the regular Skeletool. Both models weigh 5 ounces so the carbon fiber is decorative rather than genuinely weight-saving. The CX is a little sharper looking due to its darker color, but I paid the extra money to get the better knife blade. The blade on the CX is made of the tougher 154CM steel as opposed to the 420HC used for the regular Skeletool's blade. It should hold an edge better and take a little more abuse than the regular Skeletool's blade. The blade on the CX is also a partially serrated 'Combo edge' that gives it an improved ability to cut through tough webbing or ropes if necessary.",

        "body": "The Skeletool and I have had a fairly long on again, off again relationship I have purchased this tool 3 times and returned it twice.  It has to be the best looking and feeling multitool I've ever laid my eyes and hands on. I have to say that it's not the most practical nor is it the most capable.  I somehow liken the Skeletool CX to a hot chick that doesn't have the greatest personality. One tends to overlook a few inadequacies because it's just so darn gorgeous.  In 2011, I had just purchased my first Leatherman Multitool, the Wave for $77.00 at Walmart one week before purchasing the Skeletool for the very first time. It was the Stainless Steel version bought for $70.00 at Paragon Sports. I admired the overall look of the tool, but after comparing it's cost vs it's capabilities to the Leatherman Wave. It just didn't make sense to spend that much money to something which was more of a knife than a Multitool to me. I decided to return it.  In recent years in NYC where I live, the strict and often controversial interpretation of gravity knife laws have lead to many arrests. In NYC virtually any locking folder can be articulated and presented as a gravity knife. This has lead me to reevaluate my EDC. I sought advise from Kniferight.org and local law enforcement. Knige rights advised me refrain from carrying a locking folder for the moment, while NYPD advised against carrying any serrated blade and preferred that if one must carry a bladed tool that a Leatherman or Multitool would be best as a locking folding knife was often viewed as a weapon and not a tool.  Ultimately their advise pointed me to the Skeletool CX, a multitool with a non-serrated blade. I purchased my Skeletool CX for just under $65.00 including tax. After a week of carrying it in my pocket it just felt too bulky and I honestly still prefer carrying my former EDC, a Gerber Paraframe I and a Leatherman Squirt. I have carried this combination for many years and have been so pleased with it's light weightand size. I decided to return the Skeletool CX once again only to purchase it a few days later.  I am keeping it and I'll give you the reasons why.  154 CM Blade Steel Tungsten DLC On frame Carbon Fiber inlay in the handle. The best ergonomic feel and rounded edges on any Leatherman.  Yes gents, shes not perfec, she may not have a saw or a pair of scissors, but she's beautiful in her own way.  I have had my eyes set on knives with 154 cm bladesteel and also Carbon Fiber handles this multitool allows me to add both to my collection for just $65.00",

It feels comfortable in the hand and looks amazing.  There is very little flex when using the pliers, although it is possible to pinch your thumb between the handles if you are not careful.  The knife can be opened with one hand and locks in place nicely.  The bit driver feature also has a locking lever which is pressed to change bits.  I've owned other multi-tools (i.e. gerber, swiss army) and never used all the features.  The CX has the essentials leaving it light weight and well balanced.  Just clip it to the inside of your pocket with the belt clip and you can't even tell it is there.  I highly recommend it.",

Here is how I rank the usefulness of this Skeletool:    overall built in features: 7 out of 10 - strangely the ability to snap it onto a belt loop or d ring on a bag is as useful as the belt clip    Knife usefulness:  8 out of 10 - the 154 steel does really sharpen well (I use a spyderco ceramic sharpening system) holds a very sharp edge well.  The shape of the blade makes it very easy to deploy one handed.  The liner lock ensures safety when using this type of tool which does not have the ideal handle.      Screwdriver utility:  9 out of 10.  If it had a round handle I would say it is perfect but the bit holder and the second bit allow for dual size philips and flat blade without the auxiliary bit kit. I did buy the extra bits but hardly ever use them.     Pliers utility:  Some have mentioned that the palm is easily pinched - yes that will happen if you do not hold the tool with the rounded portion at your palm.  If it feels wrong, just turn it around and p;lace the side without the knife blade in your fingers and the pliers feel great.  NO pinching. The slight needle nose makes it possible to get the jaws into small areas as well.  Kudos for a great tool!",

This tool has saved my [...] more than a few times and wouldn't think twice about purchasing another one if I lost it or something.  The blade still is sharp, and pliers are prefect.

        "body": "First off I would like to say I am a Marine and had the Skeletool CX with me through a deployment work-up and a deployment to Afghanistan. I have had many multitools and knives over the years but this one was the first true combination of both. I'll start out with the bad first, the pliers broke in Afghanistan when my buddy was trying to torque a pin out of a .50-Cal cradle and the blade is ground down so both sides are about the same sharpness (granted I never sharpened it and the environment is fairly tough on equipment). For the pros this tool was able to do anything a normal multitool could do and I love the way the knife was situated for ergonomics when cutting, the clip on the end was useful for clipping the tool to my belt loops for fast attach and detaching. Overall this is an excellent tool and I would and do recommend it to anyone who needs a basic multitool or knife.",

After a quick e-mail exchange with customer service I sent the tool to them by mail, and a little more than a week later the tool came back good as new.  No hassles.",

Removing it from the package I was very pleased with the overall feel of the tool, the fit and finishes are excellent and there are no immediately noticeable sharp edges.  It was slightly heavier than I thought it would be, a little heavier than my usual EDC pocket knife, but not bad.  Like other reviewers before me I noticed that the carbon fiber may reduce the weight very slightly, however I think it mostly serves to make the tool more aesthetically pleasing. I don't have the problems with the bits that another review had, the bit in the bit holder is held in by a catch that has to be depressed to remove the bit, The other bit is very secure in the handle, although it may get loose once there is some wear on the bit.  The bottle opener works and now I'll carry it around for a while and see how it feels in the pocket.  All in all I'm very happy with the tool, it has most of the tools I use the most, lacking only the scissors, in a smaller lighter package.    Update - carried it around all day in business casual dress, the position of the pocket clip and the slim profile allow it to ride unobtrusively and comfortably in my pocket.",

I'm hooked up on multitools now and plan to purchase Letaherman Wave with pocket clip just to see how the &#34;bigger&#34; leatherman works for me.All in all, it's a great tool for a gentleman.

The Wingman is basically my everyday carry to work. It's economical and has the basic tools I need but, the quality isn't there. The Skeletool CX has the basic in tools and the quality you would expect from Leatherman plus it is light weight and the blade is phenomenal.

It's also so big that you have to have a special douchey holder for it on your belt.  (It's the same guy with his cell phone in a pouch on his belt on the otherside, btw)  I mean they're great, but you have to pull a transformer move just to use them for anything.  Need to decode a nuke?  No problem, the leatherman has got you covered.  Just need a knife?  No problem, the multi-tool has got that too.  Hope you don't need it quick though, because it's going to take about five minutes to get the thing out of the pouch, find the knife, open it, then close the handle so you can actually use it.  It really is a process.All I ever wanted was a multitool that has the things I need most in a pinch and a way to get to them quickly.  Oh, and if I could not look like a huge douchebag with the pouch on the side of my belt, that would be nice.  And holy crap they listened!  Enter the skeletool!  It's got a clip on the side so you can just clip it to your pocket.  Access isn't in an isse, and clipped like that, you don't notice it either.  The knife blade (the thing you actually use most) is on the 'outside' of the tool so you can open it and close it without unfolding the entire thing.  Awesome.  So it's got a pliers, a screwdriver (both phillips and flat), and a knife.  I'm a handyman by trade and I swear that with this thing and my cordless drill, I can do about 95% of my fixes.  My only complaint is that they say you have '9 tools', but they count the pliers as three or four because you can do different things with different parts of the jaws.  So does that mean that most of the pliers that I have at home are 'multi-tools'?  Hardly, but don't tell Leatherman that.  Also, apparently the black one costs more because it's black.  I don't know why leatherman has to be rascist like that.  I'llget over it as I spent the extra money to get the black one and I'd do it again.  I just like the look of it better.  But if you don't care, get the silver one and save yourself a couple of bucks.  Speaking of that, a hearty Huzzah! to Amazon for carrying it for thirty bucks less than everyone else.Thank you Leatherman for finally making something that you can used without a ten minute-transformy production and that I don't have to look like an @sshat because I carry the monster around all of the time on my belt.  My name is Tim, and I approve this Skeletool.",

        "body": "i love this tool. i always carry it around clipped to my belt loop.    when i first received the tool, i opened it up right away to get a feel for it. i noticed that i was bleeding a short while later. it turns out i just nicked my finger with the knife. the knife itself is VERY sharp. i highly doubt i'm going to need to sharpen it anytime soon.    the tool bits (phillips and fathead screwdriver heads) seem to work pretty well, even though they are flattened. i've used them for around the house objects where the screws were a bit too loose, and managed to tighten them, no problem.    i haven't really used the jaws yet, only the wire cutter part, which works like a charm",

I've carried a Wave for about the past 10 years and it's been the best tool I've ever had. I honestly don't understand why every man doesn't carry a Leatherman. I received a SOG EOD tool as a Christmas gift a couple years ago.  It looked cool, but snapped the screwdriver bit and cut my hand badly the first time I tried to use it.  After carrying the Wave for so many years I thought I'd try a lighter, slimmer tool that I could pocket clip carry.  So far, I love this Skeletool CX.  I doesn't have the 'toolbox' selection of tools that the Wave has, but it has the most important and commonly used ones.  The blade is great quality steel and came sharp enough to shave with.  If you're looking for a tool that has the basics, is easy to carry, and is typical Leatherman high quality, you found it.",

Like how it sits on my pocket. Had a sharp edge on the back of the blade when it is closed and clipped to my pocket. So when I would put my hand in the pocket it would scratch.

Buy this model to have the straight blade which is not hard to maintain. The bits are interchangeable and replaceable. I recommend carrying casually with the side clip and light duty with a sheath and bit driver extender. Remember this is light duty. That being said, the pliers are strong and will not break if you don't use them beyond their capacity. You won't be sorry....great tool!",

As if to try to embellish the product, the packaging described the wire cutting area as two separate 'tools', the 'regular' wire cutter and the 'heavy' one.

The other thing is the screwdriver bit that is held in by friction. I've had the tool three weeks, and the bit has already fallen out.

I missed my knife so much I ordered one when we got back.    What I like about the knife is the blade access, the pliers and the screwdriver bits. You can use your thumb to flip out the super-sharp knife blade. The pliers are useful as grips and although wouldnt want to use them for heavy duty chores, are sufficient for most daily uses. The changeable bits are nice when you dont have another screwdriver handy.    I am very satisfied with this knife and would order another one. Amazon shipping was quick, efficient.",

Some are written from ignorant people who don't know how to use the tool.      For all that the leatherman comes with.... it's not your typical 'multitool', sure you have your standard pliers/wirecutters/knife and the bit drive is only handy IF you buy the bit kit.    the bits that come with the tool are very...... feminine. they don't have any meat to them.... feel like you might snap them, even though they are made of steel.    When i first saw it, i thought oh sweet that looks awesome    and i still think it's awesome    as for one of the comments I saw about the knife. The gentleman I'm referring to was speaking about the 'one hand' knife open/close..... and unfortunately, unless your name is ralph wiggum or helen keller..... you're not gonna be cutting yourself with the knife. It's very user friendly    Also, the carabiner/bottle opener works quite well at the bar, take it off your belt, pop open a beer and clip it back on. great tool for a college student in and outside of the dorm room.    plus..... it looks cool.      price is a tad bit steep but I guess everyone sacrifices in the hope of looking cool with whatever is trendy then...      leatherman skeletool cx.... thumbs up",

        "body": "The Skeletool CX Multitool has been my go to tool for on the road or trail bicycle adjustments and repairs since 2008. Recently one of the pliers noses snapped off when I was using it with only light to moderate force. That surprised me. However, after reading the other reviews and how speedily Leatherman has repaired several other  Skeletool CXs with exactly the same issue and returned them very quickly I was relieved. However, since I was leaving on a month long bike tour in a couple of days I went ahead and bought another one while mine was being repaired. Well, I am home for three weeks before I head out for a two month bike tour, and to my surprise and dismay there is no sign of my old Skeletool CX.  In the past month there has been no communication from Leatherman and no tracking numbers in my USPS account or email. To this point I would have given the Skeletool CX the highest rating, because it is the most important tool I carry on my bicycle trips, but with this slow response I am disappointed. I emailed today and I will call tomorrow, but it should not have broken, and it should already be fixed or replaced under the 25 year warranty.Update: All the above is true about the communications, but my wife just found the package from Leatherman and my repaired Skeletool CX. I have not checked the tracking number yet, but I'll bet it came back fairly quickly. In all fairness, my wife just lost her father, her brother is very ill, and I am off on tours. My apologies. It is my go-to tool, but I am now very careful with the pliers. When I am pulling on a brake or shift cable I don't twist the pliers to bring it taut. Now I have two of them.",

The light weight makes it easy to carry in the pocket without being too bulky. The location of the bit driver makes it convenient to use but is hidden when the tool is folded.

The metal of the knife is upgraded to hold an edge better.  The carbiner and pocket clip ensure secure ways to carry it.  I lost my first leatherman wave because it fell out of my pocket.  I love the interchangeable bit.  Reminds me of the high quality bit found in the other leathermans, but this one is more lightweight.  I don't even notice it in my pocket.  Not like it's bulky big brothers.  I also got the style ps and cs and it is like a mini replica of the skeletool.  I carry them together and it's an awesome pair.

I posted an image of the damage and you can clearly see that the plier teeth are in good condition yet the arm is snapped off. I've seen this exact type of break many times on a pair of craftsman pliers made in China that I had replaced 4 times until they started producing it without the side cutter. On the other hand I've had a pair of pliers made in Japan for >20 years and have never broken them, they are of course good quality steel that does rust quite easily (a self-renewing blackened finish for free!).    The bit holder has also never worked well, in fact mine was so loose from day one that I never knew until recently that it was even there. The groove in the bit probably needs to be larger for it to function properly.    I am mostly curious to find out of the people who also broke the pliers when did they purchase theirs? Is this an issue with older models or all models?",

The Skeletool, however, is completely different. It's almost a work of art. Unlike most other Leatherman tools, this one is lightweight, stylish, comfortable to use, and has exactly what you need for an everyday-carry. Having the blade outside-accessible has got to be the greatest, but most obvious idea ever. It boggles my mind why every other multi-tool puts the blades (or any other tool) on the inside, so that you have to unfold the whole damn thing to get to it, and then have the handles cut into your fingers to use the pliers!! Leatherman finally took a moment to think about it with this tool; I only wish they would re-think some of their other products.      My only gripe with the Skeletool is that they stopped making the CX with the serrated blade, though there is some truth to the idea that the high-quality 154CM will stay so sharp that you dont need serrations, but in my opinion, a half-serrated blade is still ideal.",

I like the fact that it also has a pocket clip as well so it's easy for me to clip it to my back pocket. I haven't had any issues with it but I've only used it for about a month.",

        "body": "I love this thing! Extraordinary comfort when holding the Skeletool in hand. It is a very solid 5 oz and operates very smooth.  The blade is of great quality and when the tool is in closed possition, it is easy to access.  No need to open the actual thing to gain access to the blade.  I find this a nice selling point for the multi tools that are on Amazon.  I like the fact that it can be secured easily to the body via a sheath (the Skeletool I bought did not come with one but they can always be bought here on Amazon.), a convenient pocket clip, or the carabiner clip put through a belt loop. This will be part of my EDC.  I could write a lot more good stuff about the Skeletool but just know this...you will not be disappointed in its quality and function.  One of my favorite purchases on Amazon!",

The knife is VERY robust and has an 'edgy' design with most of the cutting edge being curved.  Obviously it is lightweight because it doesn't have very much multi.  The worst part about it is the horrible way the spare bit stows on the side of the tool.  It falls out very easily and could have been designed much better.  For the money, get something else, you'll be glad you did unless you're just absolutely stuck on the light weight and cool styling.",

I am actually kind of disappointed about that as, aside from the quality of the steel and the tungsten coating, it was the most important factor in my decision to purchase this model.

        "body": "What I Liked:  ** The blade deploys with a single hand from the outside of the multi-tool.  It's also made from 154CM, which is printed right on the blade (I love it when my knives have the blade steel printed on them), and it holds an edge pretty well.  It's not as easy to sharpen as some other steels, but you wont have to do it as often.  ** The bit driver has a release button instead of holding the bits in magnetically, so it's quite a bit sturdier than many other bit drivers.  ** A spare bit can be found tucked away in the handle.  It holds onto it pretty well, too, so you don't have to worry too much about it slipping out.  ** It has a very ergonomic feel in my hand.  ** It's only about 5 ounces.  As the tool's name would suggest, the whole tool has been skeletonized.  The blade and handle have lots of little holes drilled out to reduce the weight.  ** The wire cutters are fantastic!  Maybe I'm just used to the cheap old ones from my dad's garage, but these have far exceeded my expectations.  ** I previously stated that the pliers weren't flush.  My experience has been that it hasn't mattered a bit.  They work great.  The only problem they could ever possible pose is if I needed to pick up a single strand of hair for some reason, an problem which has yet to arise.  ** I bought this about a year ago, and I have to say that I'm pretty impressed with how well the coating on the handle and clip has stood up.  It still looks pretty good, although I don't carry this every day.  Although the same can't be said about the screwdriver bits, which started getting scratched up almost immediately (not really an issue, since it actually looks kind of cool).  ** The bottle opener/carabiner works very well.  It get very frequent use.  What I Disliked:  ** The pocket clip got just a little bit bent out of shape.  I'm not really sure how it happened, either.  It doesn't really hold very firmly in my pocket anymore.  ** Using it as a screwdriver feels a bit awkward in the hand.** The pocket clip is a bit easy to bend (I still don't even know how I did it).  I lost the tool for a couple of weeks.  Thankfully it was just stuck in my car cushions.  Bending it back was simple enough.  ** The lock on the blade seems like it would be easy to depress under heavy use (which is VERY bad for your fingers).  I'd personally recommend going easy on this blade.  If the lock came in from the other side (more like a frame lock) and was a little bit thicker, it would be great for harder use, especially with the thick spine.  The way it is now, though, it would make me uneasy to do much more than cutting up some cardboard.  I would recommend them to anyone who doesn't need all of the extra tools and weight packed into the larger multi-tools.  This is really more of a pocket knife with a decent set of pliers than a full multi-tool to me.  If you're looking for something that's more all encompassing, I'd recommend looking elsewhere (maybe Leatherman's Wave, about the same price with a lot more features).",

        "title": "An excellent light-duty tool!",
        "body": "This is a great Leatherman, I've used it almost every day since getting it.  While limited in overall tool options, what it has is exactly what most of us need for day-to-day uses.  It's not perfect, but for doing what it does so well, it's also pretty hard to fault.  One thing to note is that this is not very heavy-duty at all.  It flexes easily, and I can see how some folks have broken the pliers trying to use it for more than it can handle.  Still, used within its limitations for light-duty everyday tasks it is fantastic, and is now my EDC.  As an EDC it is a tad heavier and bulkier than a good pocket knife, but not that bad, and the pocket clip does its job.  Considering how much more you can do with it compared to just having a knife, I'd say the trade-off is absolutely worth-it!The Pros:  It is really cool looking, well designed and relatively lightweight.  The 154CM blade is the real deal, though I wish it were just a tad bigger.  There's certainly room to make it so, but as a handy pocket knife the size is fine, and it is razor sharp.  One-handed opening and closing of the blade is extremely easy, and it's very comfortable to use.  The bit drivers are excellent, and the handle folds out to make for a very comfortable full-size feeling screwdriver.  The pliers are great also, as is the wire cutter.  Again, the handle folds out into a very ergonomic design, with a curved bottom piece to wrap your fingers around.As to the Cons:  As mentioned earlier, this is a relatively light-duty tool.  The frame will flex with even a little bit of extra torque to the drivers or pliers.  Excessive force may likely lead to a bent frame or a broken plier jaw.  Used within reason, however, this shouldn't be an issue.  Also, my blade came loose rather quickly; nothing dangerous, but the torx screw needed tightening after a couple weeks of use.  Another valid complaint many have is that the pliers aren't needle-nosed, they are fairly blunt and stubby. Workfine for what they are, but much like with the blade, there's (literally) room for improvement in the design.  Finally, while it's nice to have the carabiner clip and integrated bottle-opener, these are rather superfluous extras in my opinion.  The carabiner clip is rather large and makes the overall size and shape a bit longer and clunkier than it really needs to be on that end.  And the open area inside the carabiner is pretty small, which can make it difficult to clip onto things.  I'd rather see them ditch the carabiner and improve both the size and functionality of the pocket clip, making it both wider and reversible (for tip-up carry).All in all, for EDC the Skeletool CX is hard to beat.  You get a legit one-handed knife blade, an excellent bit driver set and the ubiquitous pliers & wire cutter for just a little more size and weight than a good pocket knife alone.  On top of that it looks really cool, and the frame is very well designed ergonomically, making every tool comfortable in the hand to use.  I highly recommend this for anyone who likes pocket knives, but wants something with even more capabilities for EDC.",

Furthermore, I've been carrying the CRKT ZillaTool, and the CX has some big shoes to fill.Based on some of the lower rated reviews, I tested the CX right out of the box for the hinge breaking.  It stood up to sufficient pressure, but one characteristic of being lightweight is that it is, well, lightweight.  As a daily carry for me, this tool needs to be fairly tough, and I don't think it is, I might suggest one of the less expensive/more durable tools, like the 830846 (I haven't tested this one myself).  The pocket clip caught on something and bent one of the first times I wore it, and it's a pain to take the clip off and straighten out.  Also be careful of the pinch area between the pliers, almost got my thumb caught in there.One reviewer stated they had to wear gloves to use it, but mine wasn't that sharp.  Maybe they just used too much hand lotion. I did agree with another reviewer who noted the difficult angle/position of the handle when using the bit driver.  This will work in a pinch, but don't expect to use much torque.  The tool has a great design, looks awesome, performance leaves me wanting my CRKT (which is about one-third the price).

        "body": "I bought mine over 4 years ago. I love it. I may lose my phone or my wallet, but I have never lost this. I carry it in my front pocket with the clip attached on the outside. I feel I was lucky because back then the 154CM blade came with serrations. I use it everyday. The pliers are sturdy unless you want to twist them sideways. but turning to loosen bolts works great. You should get a pair of pliers for twisting. I have used them for soldering, computer repair, lawnmowers, light car repair and you can open them with one hand, no problem. The knife blade may be 4 years old but it isn't wore down at all from sharpening. (I carry this little knife sharpener and it is great for a quick sharpening, even the serrations. ) [[ASIN:B000O8OTNC Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener]])  As for losing the extra bits, just remove the bit and tap the part that holds the bit, to tighten the space that holds the bit in place.  The screwdriver works perfectly even though it's a little offset, but without it you can't remove a screw. So, great to have a screwdriver. I purchased the bitpack and it has all sorts of bits included but I rarely use those. If you break something they have a 25year guarantee and everyone says that the service is excellent even though I've never had to use it. It has no scissors, but it will shave paper or hair. :)  In conclusion: this is the best knife/mult-tool I have ever owned! Well worth the price.  No more bulky multi-tools for me.  UPDATE: Last week I broke the pliers, (do not twist). Within 10 days I have a brand new Skeletool after sending them in for warranty service. Cost me $4 shipping. I even said how much I liked the serrated blade and they sent me the same Skeletool with the serrated blade! Awesome customer service!!",

This second one is a great tool but it stays in the tool box and not in my pocket because of the weight.  It is light and as several other reviewer have stated for awhile it seems very stiff to open.I like knives that do not rust.  I have an Old Timer that is a great knife and has steel blades that stay sharp for a long time but the blades got pitted over time.  Most stainless steel blades seem to have to be sharpened after every use.  But I like the idea of the CX with the Tungsten DLC scratch-resistant coating.  Hopefully the blade will stay sharp longer than the usual stainless blade.",

        "body": "My life has me needing a few basic tools frequently, and the Skeletool is a much better blend of utility than my old Wave, which was too bulky and heavy to have on me all the time. As many have mentioned before, the pocket clip is a godsend. When I was looking over the Skeletool upon receiving it, I noticed the knife has a nubby little raised bump on the face of the safety lock. This little metal bump (which is not a manufacturing flaw - it is on all of them and is supposed to prevent the blade from coming open accidentally) catches the knife at a 90 degree angle (if you consider the knife to be at 0 degrees when closed and 180 when open) while retracting blade. At first I thought this was just mildly annoying since it forces you to push down the safety lock again after you've already disengaged the perfectly adequate safety lock, but decided that this redundancy was possibly designed to make the knife safer.However, a few weeks after I got it, I was using the knife to cut some cloth and when I went to close the knife, it caught on the rounded bump for a moment and then jumped off it. The serrated edge (which, like the rest of the knife, is really quite impressively sharp), propelled by the (reasonable, I assure you) force of me closing the knife, slid under my thumbnail and cut quite deeply into my thumb before I could move my thumb out of the way. I am not a careless person with knives, and I respect the danger that is intrinsic with using them. Every knife I have ever owned (and I've had my fair share) has had a smooth action in closing after unlocking the blade, and the unnatural interruption of that action seems to be a dangerous aberration in this knife's design. It seems to me that the most dangerous part of unlocking the knife is the part where you have to have your thumb sticking in airspace where the blade will be passing momentarily while applying pressure to the backside of the blade. I fail to see the improvement in safety with the secondary catch that has to be operated with the blade 50% closer to your thumb than the first time you unlocked the blade. I wrote Leatherman about this, and a customer service rep I got told me she saw what I was talking about, and although she said that they had no plans for redesign of that feature, she forwarded it to their marketing department anyways. I have no idea what the marketing department could do about this besides maybe photograph it in a way that makes the bump less noticeable, but I let it go.I ended up taking a Dremel to the bump and grinding it off. Since then, I've found it much more safe to use.EDIT: Someone in the comments suggested that I might have a defective or older model as they *should* have a ramp on the blade to push the bump down without you having to interfere with it. This is not the case with mine, but if any other owners of it can weigh in on how this particular feature is designed on their tool, I'd be interested in hearing what the consensus is.  When I wrote Leatherman about it a while ago, they did not mention that it should work otherwise than I described, which is strange. Thoughts?EDIT 2: There are now pictures available of both what the blade should look like and what mine looks like in the pictures section. There is clearly something wrong with mine, although it does not look like a manufacturing defect, merely a design oversight. If I work up the enthusiasm to do so, I'll try to get in touch with Leatherman again and see what the deal is with my blade. Despite buying my Skeletool after the poster (Michael Jackson) who put up pictures of what the blade should look like (with a ramp to depress the safety catch bump) bought his, I may have received an older model. Either that or Leatherman has begun cutting corners to save money (or NOT cutting corners in this case). I'm sorry it seems nobody is finding this review helpful. I don't think I'm being UNhelpful by mentioning defects in this product,but maybe those of you who have marked this review as not being helpful would like to weigh in?marked this review as not being helpful would like to weigh in?",

Let me tell you that the minute you hold this little multitool in your hand, you will be completely blown away by its quality and the craftsmanship that went into making it. There's really no more to be said here. It is exactly as pictured, and then some!    I don't understand how anybody can rate this useful tool with anything but 5 stars. Several people criticized this piece for being moderately heavy for its size. While I agree that it is no feather, I also believe that the actual weight precisely matches its heavy-duty-like design and appearance. And let's face it, it's a relatively cheap multitool made almost entirely from Stainless Steel. If you wanted this same configuration in super light weight, it would have to be made from something like titanium, which in turn means that it would have to retail at $200+.    The only thing I found strange is that the tool is a little greasy in certain places. I'm not sure if anybody else noticed this. I suppose this is intentional and helps lubricate the swivels. Note that this is not a complaint, but a mere observation.",
