If you have nothing, pick one up. If you can afford it and use it enough to justify the cost, pick up a panavise instead.",

I was basically taking a chance on a low priced item to see if it would suit me and was perfectly fine eating the cost if it did not.My primary use for this is repairing damaged XLR cables and so far the helping hands have indeed helped but with a few caveats that I have to work around.The base it too light. The magnifying lens feels like it weights just as much as the base and even if it doesn't, it makes the unit top heavy and susceptible to tipping over. I tend to not make use of it, but I have managed to make use of it, but I need to be careful not to bump the hands while soldering.The alligator clamps themselves grab and hold cables fine securely. The wing nuts that hold them to the base exist in two states: &#34;loose&#34; and &#34;for the love of god, where are the channel locks?!&#34; so unless you have fingertips of steel, you'll want some pliers nearby.The unit came fully assembled in the box and the glass was covered with cardboard and rubber bands to protect it, but it was just sorta shoved unglamorously into a small cardboard box. Again, it was under 7 bucks.Once I acclimated to working with it, it's fine. I don't solder often and this performs the necessary functions i require. If i soldered more frequently or were doing circuit boards or heavier items, I might be additional ones to use in tandem or upgrade to a heavy duty model or other option, but these are fine.",

They will scratch up the solder mask if you try to move a work piece without touching the clips.The wing-nuts are stamped, so they have rough, sharp edges; a little emery cloth fixed that.And the 1st joint from the base can be hard to tighten enough to hold a position.The base may be &#34;Heavy-Duty&#34; as in it won't break, but it is not very heavy, as in weight. Depending on how you position it, it can tip over under the weight of its own magnifier, so you should expect to use it with light objects or close to vertical. Or clamp the base down. The arms will hold much more than the base will balance.It's not an $80 work piece holder or even a $25 clamp. But it didn't cost $25 or $80 and its worth every bit of the $6 it cost.",

There was a cardboard sleeve around the magnifying glass to protect it, but it had fallen off.  There is a small crack in the lens as a result.  It will not effect my use though.  I have another one I can use if needed anyway.  I bought it more for the clamps and the stand.It was very easy to get all the parts pointed where I wanted.  It does take a bit of nimble fingers though.  The base is well weighted, and as long as you keep the center of gravity reasonable I don't foresee it tipping over.All in all, I only paid around $8 for it with free shipping so I am very happy with my purchase.  -1 star for the crack in the lens, and -1 for the packaging. Otherwise a 5 star product IMO.",

I may try to find some knobbed set screws at the hardware store, that would make it easier to use...but as is...I can only rate it a 3.",

I think the next time I need to use it I will use a bit of duck tape to keep it from tipping.

However, I find it difficult to twist the very small wing nuts tight enough to hold securely.  Just holding an object for inspection is ok but it's next to impossible to try to work on an object while the clamps are holding it.  Between balancing issues and not being able to tighten the wing nuts enough, I've given up trying to actually &#34;do&#34; anything to an object being held by the clamps.Also, lighting has been tricky because the object has to be very close to the magnifying lens.",

No matter how I try to initiate the lock of the main body, it always finds a way to fall over and fail to be useful at all. It just is not sturdy or well made. The clearances in the manufacturing are clearly too high for consistency.I suggest seeking elsewhere, or to get this in person where you can confirm that it can or cannot stay up.",

That's a very important part when working with small delicate wires.When it came in the mail, it was totally assembled. I used it within 5 minutes. I would never believe how good of a deal I got, I've talked to co-workers and they guessed I paid 40 bucks for it.
